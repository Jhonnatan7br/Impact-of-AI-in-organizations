       "['\"\"\"The field of animal science, and especially animal nutrition, relies heavily on modeling to accomplish its day-To-day objectives. New data streams (\"big data\") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of \"new\"modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: Technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-And-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine \"old\"and \"new\"modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained. In this review, we share our view on the current and future limitations of modeling and potential next steps for modelers in the animal sciences. First, we discuss the inherent dependencies and limitations of modeling as a human process. Then, we highlight how models, fueled by AI, can play an enhanced sustainable role in the animal sciences ecosystem. Lastly, we provide recommendations for future animal scientists on how to support themselves, the farmers, and their field, considering the opportunities and challenges the technological innovation brings.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

       " '\"\"\"The recent success of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rooted into several concomitant factors, namely theoretical progress coupled with abundance of data and computing power. Large companies can take advantage of a deluge of data, typically withhold from the research community due to privacy or business sensitivity concerns, and this is particularly true for networking data. Therefore, the lack of high quality data is often recognized as one of the main factors currently limiting networking research from fully leveraging AI methodologies potential. Following numerous requests we received from the scientific community, we release AppClassNet, a commercial-grade dataset for benchmarking traffic classification and management methodologies. AppClassNet is significantly larger than the datasets generally available to the academic community in terms of both the number of samples and classes, and reaches scales similar to the popular ImageNet dataset commonly used in computer vision literature. To avoid leaking user- and business-sensitive information, we opportunely anonymized the dataset, while empirically showing that it still represents a relevant benchmark for algorithmic research. In this paper, we describe the public dataset and our anonymization process. We hope that AppClassNet can be instrumental for other researchers to address more complex commercial-grade problems in the broad field of traffic classification and management.

       " '\"\"\"This work aims to predict the mechanical stress on the structure of a business jet in service phase from flight instrument only. A significant database obtained from test flights using aircraft instrumented with strain gauges has been provided as part of an Artificial Intelligence challenge organized by the French Ile-de-France region and the aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. Learning techniques are considered to train a prediction model of the aircraft structural stress. The proposed baseline includes a clustering step for phase identification in time series and an ensemble model with two stacked regressors. The model is trained on a dataset of 117 flights and its overall performance is evaluated on a validation set of flight sequences from 186 flights. The main advantages of the proposed learning approach are its prediction accuracy, its training frugality and its interpretability. This paper presents a global data science workflow applied to a problem of structural stress prediction. Despite a development in a constrained time period with no direct access to the data, the proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of the concept of learned virtual sensor of aircraft structural stress and paves the way for applications to other structures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"In a short span of time since its introduction, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered much interest at both personal and organizational levels. This is because of its potential to cause drastic and widespread shifts in many aspects of life that are comparable to those of the Internet and smartphones. More specifically, generative AI utilizes machine learning, neural networks, and other techniques to generate new content (e.g. text, images, music) by analyzing patterns and information from the training data. This has enabled generative AI to have a wide range of applications, from creating personalized content to improving business operations. Despite its many benefits, there are also significant concerns about the negative implications of generative AI. In view of this, the current article brings together experts in a variety of fields to expound and provide multi-disciplinary insights on the opportunities, challenges, and research agendas of generative AI in specific industries (i.e. marketing, healthcare, human resource, education, banking, retailing, the workplace, manufacturing, and sustainable IT management). © 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"The art of business process optimization and resolution through advanced analytics have gained popularity across all business sectors in recent years. An emerging stream of modern analytics methods have focused on analyzing software development firms and their approach to coding and software development, with a view to optimize key processes through data to enhance organizational value. Despite systematic developments within the field, many high throughput software suffers from incomprehensible bad program structure that results in imbalanced performance throughout its lifecycle. This phenomenon is widely known as “Code Smells, i.e., design flaws”. A series of AI and ML based algorithms and mathematical tools were developed to tackle the problem in the past. However, at the business and decision-making level there are large uncertainties on how to optimize resource allocation towards each code smell class to maximize benefit of the process. In this paper we propose a novel mathematical business model that will help business and operational managers to optimize budget and resource allocation towards detection of maximum number of smells within a system, with increased output efficiency. Our proposed model benefits from a real life validation of code smell dataset, along with detailed prescription of optimal resource allocation along with reasoning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\"\"',\n",

In a so-called Industry 4.0. era, understanding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in developed as well as in underdeveloped economies has become increasingly crucial. The purpose of this study is to shed the light on the peculiarities of Chinese AI assessing the state of art of AI in this unique and valuable context. Design/methodology/approach: Through a research based on a qualitative data analysis, the present paper suggests a new way to analyse AI and to support a better understanding of the local Chinese aspects influencing its development and implementation. Findings: The development and implementation of AI in China required tailor solutions which account for the following three main dimensions: the location (i.e. territorial extension, the administrative boundaries); the government approach; and the human capital. Originality/value: The analysis presents a broad level activity. In addition, the paper focused on Chinese scientific literature and different types of data (i.e. institutional documents, professional reports, websites and speeches in Chinese).

Hence, this study is aimed at achieving timely, anticipated and effective response throughout the cycle of a disaster, extreme weather and emergency operations management with the help of advanced technologies. This study proposes a novel, evidence-based framework (4-AIDE) that highlights the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based collaborative platforms in disaster, extreme weather and emergency situations. A qualitative approach underpinned by organizational information processing theory (OIPT) is employed to design, develop and conduct semi-structured interviews with 33 respondents having experience in AI and cloud computing industries during emergency and extreme weather situations. For analysing the collected data, axial, open and selective coding is used that further develop themes, propositions and an evidence-based framework. The study findings indicate that AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms offer a structured and logical approach to enable two-way, algorithm-based communication to collect, analyse and design effective management strategies for disaster and extreme weather situations. Managers of public systems or businesses can collect and analyse data to predict possible outcomes and take necessary actions in an extreme weather situation. Communities and societies can be more resilient by transmitting and receiving data to AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms. These actions can also help policymakers identify critical pockets and guide administration for their necessary preparation for unexpected, extreme weather, and emergency events. © 2022 The Authors\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well-being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research. © 2023 The Authors.

       " '\"\"\"ChatGPT is an AI tool that was primarily developed by OpenAI with the support of its GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 platforms and large language models. ChatGPT has been fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning technology. Various types of organizations are interested in adopting applications supported by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 platforms, but there is an acute shortage of trained workers in this field. Research is needed to investigate the role of this very new technology and skilled workers in maintaining business sustainability. Also, few studies have investigated the role of leadership motivation in accelerating business sustainability. Therefore, this study aims to examine the role of ChatGPT and skilled employees in business sustainability. It also investigates the moderating impact of leadership motivation on business sustainability. With the help of resource-based view (RBV) and the extant literature, a theoretical model was developed, which was then validated using the PLS-SEM technique on feedback from 209 respondents.

This saliency is no less important for firms operating in the agricultural technology (AgriTech) sector, where the impacts of AI-driven technologies and systems create new opportunities and challenges. We argue that with the unique characteristics of AI technologies and emerging challenges and aspirations of the AgriTech sector, there is a need to rethink traditional theories of technology adoption and readiness within AgriTech firms. In this paper, we develop an understanding of AI readiness and adoption through a fuller appreciation of micro- and meso-empirical data that delineates the determinants of AI readiness and uncovers a set of strategic components that can help AgriTech firms better manage the readiness process for AI adoption. To do this, we employ a mixed-methods approach and elicit data from 236 e-surveys and 25 interviews from an important conference in the AgriTech field.

       " '\"\"\"Taking advantage of granular data we measure the change in bank capital requirement resulting from the implementation of AI techniques to predict corporate defaults. For each of the largest banks operating in France we build by an algorithm pseudo-internal models of credit risk management for a range of methodologies extensively used in AI (random forest, gradient boosting, ridge regression, neural network). We compare these models to the traditional model usually in place that basically relies on a combination of logistic regression and expert judgement. The comparison is made along two sets of criterias capturing: the ability to pass compliance tests used by the regulators during on-site missions of model validation (i), and the induced changes in capital requirement (ii). The different models show noticeable differences in their ability to pass the regulatory tests and to lead to a reduction in capital requirement. While displaying a similar ability than the traditional model to pass compliance tests, neural networks provide the strongest incentive for banks to apply AI models for their internal model of credit risk of corporate businesses as they lead in some cases to sizeable reduction in capital requirement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\"\"\"',\n",

However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the role of intangible organisational capabilities to drive AI adoption within SMEs that will lead to SC productivity, low carbon management, and resilience. To bridge this gap in the literature, our research employs perceived organisational support (POS) as the theoretical lens to develop a theoretical model that is tested by surveying 375 Vietnamese managers of manufacturing SMEs. Our findings from structural equation modelling analysis demonstrate that organisational change capacity will facilitate AI adoption, which will lead to SC productivity, resilience, and low carbon management because of SMEs’ ability to leverage AI for data-driven decision making. Based on POS theory, our research highlights the role of intangible SME resources in implementing sustainable digital SCs’ transformation, an essential strategy for acting as IIs in business ecosystems. Our findings will help SMEs to develop strategies that will enhance skills, competencies, expertise, and organisational creativity conducive to the needs of the human workforce. This will enhance the capacity and capability of SMEs to innovate, manage, and efficiently adapt to change in a technologically turbulent, dynamic, uncertain, and volatile business environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted within Human Resource management (HRM) due to its potential to create value for consumers, employees, and organisations. However, recent studies have found that organisations are yet to experience the anticipated benefits from AI adoption, despite investing time, effort, and resources. The existing studies in HRM have examined the applications of AI, anticipated benefits, and its impact on human workforce and organisations. The aim of this paper is to systematically review the multi-disciplinary literature stemming from International Business, Information Management, Operations Management, General Management and HRM to provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of the organisational resources required to develop AI capability in HRM. Our findings show that organisations need to look beyond technical resources, and put their emphasis on developing non-technical ones such as human skills and competencies, leadership, team co-ordination, organisational culture and innovation mindset, governance strategy, and AI-employee integration strategies, to benefit from AI adoption. Based on these findings, we contribute five research propositions to advance AI scholarship in HRM. Theoretically, we identify the organisational resources necessary to achieve business benefits by proposing the AI capability framework, integrating resource-based view and knowledge-based view theories.

       " '\"\"\"Introduction: Artificial Intelligence-based Medical Devices (AI-based MDs) are experiencing exponential growth in healthcare. This study aimed to investigate whether current studies assessing AI contain the information required for health technology assessment (HTA) by HTA bodies. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology to extract articles published between 2016 and 2021 related to the assessment of AI-based MDs. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, technology, algorithms, comparators, and results. AI quality assessment and HTA scores were calculated to evaluate whether the items present in the included studies were concordant with the HTA requirements. We performed a linear regression for the HTA and AI scores with the explanatory variables of the impact factor, publication date, and medical specialty. We conducted a univariate analysis of the HTA score and a multivariate analysis of the AI score with an alpha risk of 5 %. Results: Of 5578 retrieved records, 56 were included. The mean AI quality assessment score was 67 %; 32 % of articles had an AI quality score ≥ 70 %, 50 % had a score between 50 % and 70 %, and 18 % had a score under 50 %. The highest quality scores were observed for the study design (82 %) and optimisation (69 %) categories, whereas the scores were lowest in the clinical practice category (23 %). The mean HTA score was 52 % for all seven domains. 100 % of the studies assessed clinical effectiveness, whereas only 9 % evaluated safety, and 20 % evaluated economic issues. There was a statistically significant relationship between the impact factor and the HTA and AI scores (both p = 0.046). Discussion: Clinical studies on AI-based MDs have limitations and often lack adapted, robust, and complete evidence. High-quality datasets are also required because the output data can only be trusted if the inputs are reliable. The existing assessment frameworks are not specifically designed to assess AI-based MDs. From the perspective of regulatory authorities, we suggest that these frameworks should be adapted to assess the interpretability, explainability, cybersecurity, and safety of ongoing updates. From the perspective of HTA agencies, we highlight that transparency, professional and patient acceptance, ethical issues, and organizational changes are required for the implementation of these devices. Economic assessments of AI should rely on a robust methodology (business impact or health economic models) to provide decision-makers with more reliable evidence. Conclusion: Currently, AI studies are insufficient to cover HTA prerequisites. HTA processes also need to be adapted because they do not consider the important specificities of AI-based MDs. Specific HTA workflows and accurate assessment tools should be designed to standardise evaluations, generate reliable evidence, and create confidence. © 2023 The Author(s)\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Key-value extraction is a challenging task in document AI, particularly in business documents such as invoices. Accurately extracting key-value pairs from such documents is crucial for downstream tasks like accounting, analytics, and decision-making. In this paper, we propose a method for grouping and linking key-value pairs in business documents using a combination of rule-based methods and pretrained transformers. Our method comprises three steps: grouping words into word groups using rule-based methods that rely on layout information obtained via OCR, classifying the groups of words into key, value, or other using a pretrained BERT multilingual model, and linking the predicted key-value pairs based on their relative positions in the document, leveraging the layout information. Furthermore, we present a comparative study of our approach against state-of-the-art methods for key-value extraction in business documents. Our approach is designed to be adaptable and requires minimal semantic and language-specific knowledge, making it suitable for a wide range of business documents. This flexibility allows our method to be easily applied to real-world scenarios, where documents may vary in layout and language. Additionally, our method is computationally efficient, allowing for fast processing of large volumes of documents. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining rule-based methods with pretrained transformers for key-value extraction in business documents, providing a strong foundation for developing more accurate and robust methods in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\"\"',\n",

We first present a theoretical review of the concept of business creativity and the impact of AI on organizational creativity as a possible way to predict different dimensions of creative output. We conducted several exploratory interviews with managers and key leaders in the field, and we summarize the reflection by adopting the “three-dimensional concurrent engineering” framework (Fine et al., 2002), which adds value chain engineering to augment the traditional two-dimensional concurrent engineering of products and processes. Adopting this framework, we specifically investigate three main dimensions in which AI systems have to stimulate business creativity: (1) product/service design - stimulating continuous and ongoing innovation allowing new product/service design; (2) new optimized processes and procedures across teams; (3) assistance to organizations to be more creative by facilitating and increasing collaborations (sharing of resources) and alliances. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Margherita Pagani and Renaud Champion; individual chapters, the contributors.\"\"\"',\n",

In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and context-aware policies are certainly major options to move in this direction and to adapt service delivery to changing user needs, environmental conditions and business objectives. In this paper, we step towards this objective by addressing the problem of optimal placement of dynamic virtual networks through a self-adaptive learning-based strategy. These constantly evolving networks present, however, several challenges, mainly due to their stochastic nature, and the high dimensionality of the state and the action spaces. This curse of dimensionality requires, indeed, a broader exploration, which is not always compatible with a real-time execution in an operational network. Thus, we propose DQMC, a new strategy for virtual network embedding in mobile networks combining a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) strategy, namely a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Monte Carlo (MC). As learning is costly in time and computing resources, and sensitive to changes in the network, we suggest a control-theory-based techniques to dynamically leverage exploration in DQMC. This leads to fast, efficient, and sober learning compared to a Monte Carlo-based strategy. This also ensures a reliable solution even in the case of a change in the requests’ sizes or a node\\'s failure, showing promising perspectives for solutions combining control-theory and machine learning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Financial Markets in Practice: From Post-Crisis Intermediation to FinTechs delivers an overview of the development of risk-transformation undertaken by the financial services industry from the perspective of quantitative finance. It provides an instructional and comprehensive explanation of the structure of the financial system as a network of risk suppliers and risk consumers, where different categories of market participants buy, transform, net, and re-sell different kinds of risks. This risk-transformation oriented view is supported by the changes that followed the last global financial crisis: consumers of financial products asked for less complex risk transformations, regulators demanded limiting risks inside financial institutions to the maximum extent possible, and market participants turned to run mass market-like businesses and away from bespoke \"haute couture\"-like businesses. This book portrays the network of intermediaries that compose the financial system, describes their most common business models, explains the exact role of each kind of market participant, and underlines the interaction between them. It seeks to reveal the potential disintermediation that could occur inside the financial sector, led by FinTechs and Artificial Intelligence-based innovations. Readers are invited to reconsider the role of market participants in the post-crisis world and are prepared for the next wave of changes driven by data science, AI, and blockchain. Amid these innovations, quantitative finance will be increasingly involved in all aspects of the financial system. This handy resource helps practitioners from both the buy-side and sell-side gain insights to, and provides an overview of, business models in the financial system from an intermediation perspective, and guides students to comprehensively understand the complex ecosystem in which they will evolve. © 2022 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

       " '\"\"\"Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BT), have revolutionized the way businesses are managed nowadays, whereas the focus on financial resilience remains critical even in an era of complexity and uncertainty. This study empirically explores the capabilities of AI and BT to ascertain its role in financial resilience of a supply chain. Further study considers the environmental dynamism moderating the relationship of AI and BT leading to financial resilience of supply chains. Adopting a multi-methodological approach, we conduct an empirical and qualitative study to explore the relationship between AI, BT, and the financial resilience of supply chains. For data collection, 202 survey responses from supply chain professionals were collected to test the theoretical model, whereas the qualitative study collected responses from 25 supply chain professionals using semi-structured interviews and the grounded approach. After using structural equation modeling for the quantitative data analysis, our findings indicate that, compared to artificial intelligence, blockchain technology is stronger in facilitating financial resilience of a supply chain under the moderating influence of environmental dynamism. Thematic analysis for the qualitative study indicate the role of AI in sensing, blockchain in seizing and financial resilience in reconfiguring the opportunities lie in supply chain. AI is suitable for sensing the business environment and facilitating blockchain deployment.

AI-based recruitment tools are changing the way recruitment processes are conducted. However, the perception of AI technology from the candidate\\'s perspective has received limited coverage in the literature. Since little is known about how applicants experience AI-enabled recruitment, this paper explores their experiences and perceptions in hiring processes. The results of this study show that applicants perceive AI technology positively in hiring processes and see it as useful and easy to use. In terms of advantages, reduced response time was recognized as the most significant benefit.

A huge population of humanity still lacks basic access to the necessary healthcare diagnostic facilities, the first step to curbing diseases and mortality rates. One such example is the Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, a technology discovered in 1950s, miniaturised to fit in 50kg for the International Space Station, yet there are 36000 MRI scanners worldwide, even Japan with most MRI Scanners have only 51 scanners per million people India, the second largest country in the world, has 1 scanner per million people. The cost of an MRI scan is USD 4000, with nearly 80,000 scans a year in India. The numbers clearly indicate the economic restrictions to diagnostic access, which this work intends to change through commercial viability assessment of leveraging space technology and operational advancements to equalize access to MRI diagnostics, utilizing the support schemes and low cost manufacturing and skilled workforce capabilities inherent to India and other developing nations, coupled with Halbach array electromagnets to provide multi mode imaging capabilities to cater to different imaging performance needs while concentrating maximum field in bore, miniaturized SAR RF systems with satellite SDR kits for generating gradients at lower costs and processing difficulties, eliminating cryogenic fluid requirements to substantially decrease costs and architectural and infrastructural requirements in hospitals and imaging centres, cloud computing to leverage techniques of processing multi node data input terminals powered by deep learning algorithms powering neural networks and AI along with network architectures to ensure fast, safe and redundant data processing and provision to doctors and patients to reduce image processing and radiological comprehension costs and difficulties, amongst other technologies from R&D and innovations proven in space, minus the stringent and expensive space grade qualifications, with international business models and SpaceX-inspired supply chain operations strategy of indigenous manufacturing of all components and assembly under one roof for quick time to market, low cost, portability, decreased cost to hospitals and patients without compromising performance, sustainability and commercial viability in a nation lacking such an ecosystem.

       " '\"\"\"The remarkable growth of ChatGPT, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), has triggered a significant debate in society. It has the potential to radically transform the business landscape, with consequences for operations and supply chain management (O&SCM). However, empirical evidence on Gen-AI\\'s effects in O&SCM remains limited. This study investigates the benefits, challenges, and trends associated with Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. We collected data from O&SCM practitioners in the UK (N = 154) and the USA (N = 161). As we used the organizational learning theory for the research, our findings reveal increased efficiency as a significant benefit for both adopters and non-adopters in both countries, while indicating security, risks, and ethical as prominent concerns. In particular, it appeared that the integration of Gen-AI/ChatGPT leads to the enhancement of the overall supply chain performance. Moreover, organizational learning can speed up the results of Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. No wonders that adopters express their satisfaction about the post-implementation benefits of the technology, which include reduced perceived challenges for pre-implementation, and greater optimism about future Gen-AI/ChatGPT utilization compared to non-adopters. Adopters also display diverse behavioral patterns toward efficiency, agility, responsiveness, etc. This study provides valuable insights for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers interested in comprehending Gen-AI/ChatGPT\\'s implications in O&SCM for both adopters and non-adopters.

       " '\"\"\"Parallel DBMSs have become more and more mature and getting several success stories in the industry. This situation has been reached by powerful data partitioning and data allocation techniques and algorithms. By analyzing these findings closely, we figure out that they are quickly stressed by the workload changes, which represents the usual case of business analytics applications. To deal with this challenge in the context of big data warehouses, several studies proposed to move to another processing paradigm outside the DBMS realm such as Spark by proposing adaptive partitioning solutions to tackle the workload changes. The majority of approaches are offline and those that are online cause significant random disk I/O costs. This is because the correlation that may exist between jobs and data blocks read from the disk is not captured to refine the adaptive partitioning algorithms. This represents one of the major causes of providing high performance of dynamic workloads. To solve such limitations, we propose in this paper a proactive framework for query-aware adaptive partitioning (called PROADAPT) that uses an AI-inspired methodology that can be connected to any query optimizer managing partitioned data. This methodology uses a genetic algorithm to solve our formalized problem that considers the interaction that may exist among workload queries. PROADAPT intensively rewrites queries by exploiting dimension hierarchies to skip irrelevant data and then improves I/O performance. Different technical modules of our framework are discussed. Finally, we conduct intensive experiments on Postgres-XL and a Spark SQL parallel cluster to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\"\"\"',\n",

However, IoT devices alone tend to strain enterprise systems with a sheer volume of unstructured and unfiltered data. To overcome this challenge, endowing (smart) devices with AI-based capabilities can significantly enhance enterprise system capabilities. However, deploying AI-based capabilities on potentially insecure edge hardware and platforms introduces new security risks, including AI model theft, poisoning, and data leaks. This paradigm shift necessitates the protection of distributed AI applications and data.

Extracting key-value information from business documents is a challenging problem due to the variety of document types and templates, in this work we will deal with the problem as a graph node classification problem using a multi “graph transformer\" layers, we propose a graph construction method that focuses on the most relevant neighbours of every node while reducing the size of the graph and we use a document transformer embedding combined with some spatial and textual feature to give a better representation to each node. Our contribution in this work was to conceive a graph neural network (GNN) achieving the highest results comparing to the rest of GNN models dealing with the same problem to our knowledge, the model is small (53,6K parameters) comparing to the recent models using transformers architectures (hundreds of millions of parameters) which is very suitable for applications when storage constraints are present, it also has a limited impact on the environment and represent an alternative to build greener AI systems.

Focusing on an innovative AV design (AD) concept, this paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain-based Smart Contracts can enhance sustainable supply chain operations. A novel design element, Margin Indicator (MI), is developed to obtain reliable predictive analytics results from the mainstream machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach supports a robust control of costs and energy, while maintaining a high level of transparency in managing decentralized AV supply chain processes, monetary impacts, and environmental sustainability.

It discusses Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. For each of three major A&F functions – financial accounting, management accounting, and control and treasury – the influences of these technologies are analysed. The present day seems decisive for the A&F profession, concerning how it may evolve, expand or lose relevance to other competing professions. Variations of accounting hybridisation and the ‘business partner’ role emerge. A new hybridisation is unfolding between the A&F and information technology (IT)/data science, and the ‘business partner’ role may be taken by professionals coming from the latter area. In fact, A&F professionals lack increasingly required IT and data science skills, and companies are turning to hire IT and data science professionals to deliver these high value-added contributions. Therefore, A&F professionals should upskill to at least a basic level, increasingly required for core activities of A&F and to interact within multidisciplinary teams. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Erik Strauss and Martin Quinn; individual chapters, the contributors.All rights reserved.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Consumers’ dramatic demand has a pernicious effect throughout the supply chain. It exacerbates inventory distortion because of significant revenue loss caused by stock-level issues. Despite the availability of several forecasting techniques, large organisations, manufacturing firms, and e-commerce websites collectively lose around $1.8 trillion annually to inventory distortion. If this problem is solved, sales may increase by 10.3 percent. The businesses are concerned about mitigating this loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a significant role in building resilient supply chains. However, developing AI models consumes time and cost. In this paper, we propose a No Code Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) enabling non-technical companies to build machine learning models based on production quantity and inventory replenishment. The development of the NCAI model is fast and inexpensive. However, little research deals with applying NCAI to operations and supply chain problems.

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital technologies applications continue to emerge to enhance and improve novel ways of communication on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Indeed, this has caused a change in the behavioral and social customer journey, where customers need to embrace a digital experience adoption. The AI applications primarily aim to study the shoppers browsing trend to draw new clients and expand businesses. Even the fashion industry has tapped into Instagram\\'s business benefits in this fast-paced and competitive industry. With this quick and compelling way to capture shoppers’ attention towards fashion products, the purchase decision may differ between e-shoppers and conventional shoppers. AI seems to be extremely promising and has the potential to be a game changer for Instagram users, advertisers, and influencers. This study applies the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) theory to investigate the effects of AI-based digital technology experiences on Instagrammers’ fashion apparel purchase decisions - perceived eWOM, perceived emotional value, perceived quality, perceived risk and perceived price. Based on data collected from Instagram users, the framework of this study was evaluated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Semi-structured in-depth interviews were also conducted as part of the research to get a more in-depth understanding of the profiles and behaviors of Instagram users. Our findings from both methodologies confirm that perceived emotional value, perceived quality, and perceived eWOM revealed a statistically significant and positive influence on Instagrammers’ purchase decisions for fashion apparel. Meanwhile, the importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified perceived emotional value as the most important factor for Instagrammers, but the highest performance was perceived quality.

       " '\"\"\"Driven by the need to provide continuous, timely, and efficient customer service, firms are constantly experimenting with emerging technological solutions. In recent times firms have shown an increased interest in designing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactional technologies, such as conversational AI agents and chatbots, that obviate the need for having human service agents for the provision of customer service. However, the business impact of conversational AI is contingent on customers using and adequately engaging with these tools. This engagement depends, in turn, on conversational AI’s similarity, or likeness to the human beings it is intended to replace. Businesses therefore need to understand what human-like characteristics and competencies should be embedded in customer-facing conversational AI agents to facilitate smooth user interaction. This focus on “human-likeness” for facilitating user engagement in the case of conversational AI agents is in sharp contrast to most prior information systems (IS) user engagement research, which is predicated on the “instrumental value” of information technology (IT). Grounding our work in the individual human competency and media naturalness literatures, we theorize the key role of human-like interactional competencies in conversational AI agents—specifically, cognitive, relational, and emotional competencies—in facilitating user engagement. We also hypothesize the mediating role of user trust in these relationships. Following a sequential mixed methods approach, we use a quantitative two-wave, survey-based study to test our model. We then examine the results in light of findings from qualitative follow-up interviews with a sampled set of conversational AI users. Together, the results offer a nuanced understanding of desirable human-like competencies in conversational AI agents and the salient role of user trust in fostering user engagement with them. We also discuss the implications of our study for research and practice. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"\"\"',\n",

With the proliferation of digital computing devices and the emergence of big data, AI is increasingly offering significant opportunities for society and business organizations. The growing interest of scholars and practitioners in AI has resulted in the diversity of research topics explored in bulks of scholarly literature published in leading research outlets. This study aims to map the intellectual structure and evolution of the conceptual structure of overall AI research published in Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TF&SC). This study uses machine learning-based structural topic modeling (STM) to extract, report, and visualize the latent topics from the AI research literature. Further, the disciplinary patterns in the intellectual structure of AI research are examined with the additional objective of assessing the disciplinary impact of AI. The results of the topic modeling reveal eight key topics, out of which the topics concerning healthcare, circular economy and sustainable supply chain, adoption of AI by consumers, and AI for decision-making are showing a rising trend over the years. AI research has a significant influence on disciplines such as business, management, and accounting, social science, engineering, computer science, and mathematics.

       " '\"\"\"Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technology has generated a new dynamic that empowers the advertising business and social networking environment. In terms of convenience, consumers benefit from the generation of customized ad content through their activities on social network sites (SNS). However, concerns about data privacy and impaired well-being remain, notably in relation to Generation Z consumers, who are considered tech-savvy, narcissistically-oriented, and vulnerable in their SNS usage. Drawing on cognitive dissonance theory, we show how a dilemma of convenience vs. privacy drives their technology dissonance and their dependence on SNS. Our empirical study in the US demonstrates the trade-off between convenience and privacy that results from the customizability of technology, the opposite functions of these facets in technology dissonance, and the negative impact on SNS dependence. When the key role of the ego in the dissonance in Generation Z\\'s SNS behavior is recognized, vulnerable narcissism is found to show nuances of psychological dissonance induced by privacy concerns.

       " '\"\"\"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have transformed business functions and contributed significantly to improving the efficiency of business operations. Unlike other technologies, AI models keep dynamically improving based on past data. Most scholars have considered AI to be a strategic resource or technology in the organizational context. Most research on AI based on empirical evidence has been focussed on either its technological or resource-based aspects. Along with improved work efficiency, a looming sense of uncertainty is causing a dip in trust and transparency in business operations. Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) offers a solution suited to address this concern. RAI is a governance framework that documents how a specific organization addresses the challenges centred on AI from both the ethical and legal points of view. Few studies have attempted to explain how RAI could be used to swiftly improve trust and transparency. We set out to use fit viability theory and a selective organizational information privacy and security violations model (SOIPSVM) to answer two critical research questions. RQ 1: How does RAI help firms help improve supply chain coordination and supply chain performance? RQ 2: How does organizational culture moderate the relationships of RAI with fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency? To this end, we tested our hypotheses by means of empirical data collected from the Indian service sector using the Warp PLS 7.0 software. Our results help extend the theoretical base of fit viability theory to the context of RAI in micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector’s supply chain operations. The study also help MSMEs to understand the importance and application of RAI in improving their supply chain processes, which can help them reduce costs and improve efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\"\"',\n",

These news articles often cover the same events and report redundant information. Existing news platforms aim at collecting the key entities from news articles and providing a mechanism to view the latest and relevant business events based on user interest. However, they do not provide a method to model business events and understand them temporally, spatially, and contextually (i.e. changes in the event). For instance, it is crucial to know for how long a business event has been active? How important is its evolution locally, or worldwide? Or how did different companies come up with this event as competitors in the market? The contribution of this research is the exploration of the possibilities of modeling spatial, temporal, and contextual information evolution related to business events through the application of knowledge graphs and text analytics, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The constructed knowledge graphs through Named-Entity Recognition (NER), i.e., an NLP technique, present a compact news representation that tells the key entities of the business event at one glance using linked open data concepts. It enables the assessment of other related news events as well as provides the means for analysis of the influence and evolution of business events.  © 2022 ACM.\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"Artificial intelligence has developed and advanced to the point where it is now effectively implemented in every domain of life, including music. The music business is being fundamentally changed by shrewd, intellectual methods that rely on AI. These tools make it very easy for musicians to create high-caliber music. Today, sophisticated and clever robots are capable of creating and composing music, one of the most fascinating and priceless works of human ingenuity. Intelligent programs based on artificial intelligence have enabled robots to create beautiful music without the involvement of any humans. The proposed article is focused on the usage of AI-grounded techniques for the learning of music and its classification. It shows that with new technologies, highly interactive interfaces and classrooms can now be developed for the effective and efficient teaching and learning of music. Almost all of the students favor the implementation of such methodologies to improve their performance in music learning and composition. The need for time to employ AI for the quick improvement of the students’ musical talent allows them to become professionals in their field. The design of animated courses with the integration of virtual reality and artificial intelligence can enhance the interest of students in learning and developing their skills. The study then acquired various important characteristics from the existing literature in the area of research and selected the most common ones. Then, with the implementation of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), these features are assigned weights. For the ranking of the alternatives, the method of multi-objective optimization on the basis of research analysis was utilized. AI-based methods in music education have several advantages and are revolutionizing how students learn about and interact with music. Personalized learning, accessible education, improved practice and performance, help with composition and arrangement, and music theory and analysis are some of the main benefits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in customer relationship management (CRM) holds great potential for enhancing organizational effectiveness. To achieve successful AI-CRM integration, companies must navigate a landscape filled with challenges and complexities marked by the distinctive nature of CRM processes. However, both academics and practitioners still face challenges in understanding the organizational and managerial elements crucial for successful AI-CRM integration. This study aims to fill this gap by identifying the challenges businesses must overcome in the process of AI integration in a CRM context, from the first discover phase to the final sustain phase. Since the context of AI-CRM integration encompasses expertise in artificial intelligence, customer relationship management, data science, and business management, we utilize a research approach that involves qualitative interviews with several actors (managers, consultants and specialists) across these domains to gain diverse insights into AI-CRM integration challenges and opportunities. We identified eleven specific challenges associated with AI-powered CRM and uncovered a temporal division of these challenges across the four phases of AI implementation. Furthermore, we have developed guidelines for addressing them effectively. The findings contribute to an empirical understanding of AI-CRM integration, offering a long-term perspective on leveraging AI for customer relationships. This research lays the foundation for exploring the activities and capabilities required to navigate the challenges of AI-CRM integration and provides essential questions for managers embarking on this journey. © 2023 The Authors\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"Over the past decades, industries and governments have progressively been relying upon space data-centric and data-dependant systems. This led to the emergence of malicious activities, also known as cyber-threats, targeting such systems. To counter these threats, new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been implemented and deployed. Today, AI is highly capable of delivering fast, precise, and reliable command-and-control decision-making, as well as providing reliable vulnerability analysis using well-proven cutting-edge techniques, at least when applied to terrestrial applications. In fact, this might not yet be the case when used for space applications. AI can also play a transformative and important role in the future of space cybersecurity, and it poses questions on what to expect in the near-term future. Challenges and opportunities deriving from the adoption of AI-based solutions to achieve cybersecurity and later cyber defence objectives in both civil and military operations require rethinking of a new framework and new ethical requirements. In fact, most of these technologies are not designed to be used or to overcome challenges in space. Because of the highly contested and congested environment, as well as the highly interdisciplinary nature of threats to AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, including cybersecurity issues, a solid and open understanding of the technology itself is required, as well as an understanding of its multidimensional uses and approaches. This includes the definition of legal and technical frameworks, ethical dimensions and other concerns such as mission safety, national security, and technology development for future uses. The continuous endeavours to create a framework and regulate interdependent uses of combined technologies such as AI and cybersecurity to counter “new” threats require the investigation and development of “living concepts” to determine in advance the vulnerabilities of networks and AI. This paper defines a cybersecurity risk and vulnerability taxonomy to enable the future application of AI in the space security field. Moreover, it assesses to what extent a network digital twins’ simulation can still protect networks against relentless cyber-attacks in space against users and ground segments. Both concepts are applied to the case study of Earth Observation (EO) operations, which allows for conclusions to be drawn based on the business impact (reputational, environmental, and social) of a cyber malicious activity. Since AI technologies are developing on a daily basis, a regulatory framework is proposed using ethical and technical approaches for this technology and its use in space. © 2023 International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"This study presents a comprehensive literature review using a systematic approach to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in promoting sustainable development in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The systematic review approach was applied to collect and analyze topics, and the literature search was conducted in two stages, encompassing 57 articles that met the research requirements. Our analysis reveals that AI\\'s contribution to sustainability is concentrated within three key areas: organizational, technical, and processing aspects. The organizational aspect focuses on the integration of AI in companies and industries, addressing barriers to implementation and the relationship between companies, partners, and customers. The technical aspect highlights the development of AI algorithms that can address global challenges and contribute to the growth of stability and development in society. The processing aspect emphasizes the internal transformation of companies, their business models, and strategies in response to AI integration. Our proposed conceptual model outlines the essential elements organizations must consider when incorporating AI into their sustainability efforts, such as strategic alignment, infrastructure development, change management, and continuous improvement. By addressing these critical aspects, organizations can harness the potential of AI to drive positive social, environmental, and economic outcomes, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. The model serves as a comprehensive framework for organizations seeking to leverage AI for sustainable development, but it should be adapted to individual contexts to ensure its relevance and effectiveness. © 2023 The Authors.

       " '\"\"\"The transition towards Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is rapidly transforming the digital realm and providing new avenues for creativity for all humanity. In the past two years, several generative models have disrupted worldwide, including ChatGPT and DALL-E 2, developed by OpenAI, which are currently receiving significant media attention. These models can generate new content, respond to prompts, and automatically create new images and videos. Nevertheless, despite this progress of GAI, research into its application in business and industry is still in its infancy. Generative AI is bringing ground-breaking innovations that go beyond the limitations of conventional Contextual AI. This new type of AI can generate novel patterns in human-like creativity, encompassing various forms of content such as text, images, and media. It transforms how people communicate, create, and share content, taking organizations by surprise. Unfortunately, these organizations were not fully prepared as they were focused on the advancements and impacts of Contextual AI. Given the significant organizational-societal opportunities and challenges posed by generative models, it is crucial to comprehend their ramifications. However, the excessive hype surrounding GAI currently makes it difficult to determine how organizations can effectively utilize and regulate these powerful algorithms. In research, the primary question is how organizations can manage the intersection of human creativity and machine creativity, and how can they leverage this intersection to their advantage? To address this question and mitigate concerns related to it, a comprehensive understanding of GAI is essential. Therefore, this paper aims to provide technical insights into this paradigm and analyze its potential, opportunities, and constraints for business and industrial research. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Companies aiming at online data sources for extracting business insights often experience the issue of managing different collections of datasets. It is because online business-related data is growing over time. This increasing data demands more storage. But saving the irrelevant data will cost more to companies. To overcome the problems of data integration and scalability, the idea of Virtual Knowledge Graphs (VKGs) is exploited. Moreover, text processing methods based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) are utilized for improving the identification of relevant business news data. The contribution of this work is twofold that is presented using a business case study. First, we have applied the concept of VKG to expand the company database. The expansion is required for adding more business-related data from the news articles to improve the process of identifying its relevance as per the end-user\\'s interests. Second, we have proposed the text relevance resolution matrix and its working is shown through NLP techniques for identifying relevant news data. Populating the modeled VKG with relevant news data will save database space and prevent manual labor.

Human Resources (HR) management and talent development make no exception, as they tend to involve more automation and growing quantities of data. Because this brings implications on workforce, career transparency, and equal opportunities, overseeing what fuels AI and analytical models, their quality standards, integrity, and correctness becomes an imperative for those aspiring to such systems. Based on an ontology transformation to B-machines, this article presents an approach to constructing a valid and error-free career agent with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In short, the agent\\'s policy is built on a framework we called Multi State-Actor (MuStAc) using a decentralized training approach. Its purpose is to predict both relevant and valid career steps to employees, based on their profiles and company pathways (observations). Observations can comprise various data elements such as the current occupation, past experiences, performance, skills, qualifications, and so on. The policy takes in all these observations and outputs the next recommended career step, in an environment set as the combination of an HR ontology and an Event-B model, which generates action spaces with respect to formal properties.

       " '\"\"\"In 2018, the “Ateliers de Giens” (Giens Workshops) devoted a workshop to artificial intelligence (AI) and led its experts to confirm the potential contribution and theoretical benefit of AI in clinical research, pharmacovigilance, and in improving the efficiency of care. The 2022 workshop is a continuation of this reflection on AI and intelligent automation (IA) by focusing on its contribution to pharmacovigilance and the applications and tasks could be optimized to preserve and strengthen medical and pharmacological expertise in pharmacovigilance. The evolution of pharmacovigilance work is characterized by many tasks with low added value, a growing volume of pharmacovigilance reporting of suspected side effects, and a scarcity of medical staff with expertise in clinical pharmacology and pharmacovigilance and human resources to support this growing need. Together, these parameters contribute to an embolization of the pharmacovigilance system at risk of missing its primary mission: to identify and characterize a risk or even a health alert on a drug. The participants of the workshop (representatives of the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres (CRPV), the French National Agency for Safety of Medicinal Products (ANSM), patients, the pharmaceutical industry, or start-ups working in the development of AI in the field of medicine) shared their experiences, their pilot projects and their expectations on the expected potential, theoretical or proven, AI and IA. This work has made it possible to identify the needs and challenges that AI or IA represent, in the current or future modes of organization of pharmacovigilance activities. This approach led to the development of a SWOT matrix (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), a basis for reflection to identify critical points and consider four main recommendations: (1) preserve and develop business expertise in pharmacovigilance (including research and development in methods) with the integration of new technologies; (2) improve the quality of pharmacovigilance reports; (3) adapt technical and regulatory means; (4) implement a development strategy for AI and IA tools at the service of expertise. © 2022\"\"\"',\n",

Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) prediction models can help to classify the likelihood of employees voluntarily departing from employment using historical employee datasets. However, output responses generated by these AI-based ML models lack transparency and interpretability, making it difficult for HR managers to understand the rationale behind the AI predictions. If managers do not understand how and why responses are generated by AI models based on the input datasets, it is unlikely to augment data-driven decision-making and bring value to the organisations. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the capability of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to intuitively explain the ET predictions generated by AI-based ML models for a given employee dataset to HR managers. From a theoretical perspective, we contribute to the International Human Resource Management literature by presenting a conceptual review of AI algorithmic transparency and then discussing its significance to sustain competitive advantage by using the principles of resource-based view theory. We also offer a transparent AI implementation framework using LIME which will provide a useful guide for HR managers to increase the explainability of the AI-based ML models, and therefore mitigate trust issues in data-driven decision-making. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\"\"\"',\n",

However, firms can make substantial progress by adopting regenerative approaches grounded in circular economy principles, enabling them to effectively pursue sustainable development objectives such as responsible production and consumption (goal 12), climate action (goal 13), and the preservation of life on land (goal 15). However, there is a scarcity of research studies that offer guidance to top supply chain (SC) executives, aiming to enhance their environmental focus and enhance the SC viability through regenerative SC practices. This study employed the philosophical perspective of the natural resource-based view. Advancing the SC literature, it tested a theoretical model to investigate the relationship between the political skills and SC analytics skills of top SC executives and the environmental orientation of SCs. Additionally, it examined the direct and indirect (via regenerative SC) relationships between a firm\\'s environmental orientation and SC viability. This study also tested the moderating role of a firm\\'s artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics culture in these relationships. Applying a mixed-methods approach, the study derived a theoretical model to link the aforementioned constructs.

The results indicated that the relationship between the political skills and SC analytics skills of top SC executives toward the environmental orientation of SCs is significant. Furthermore, they indicated that a firm\\'s environmental orientation is positively related to a regenerative SC, which in turn enhances SC viability.

       " '\"\"\"With growing environmental concerns and the exploitation of ubiquitous big data, smart transportation is transforming logistics business and operations into a more sustainable approach. To answer questions in intelligent transportation planning, such as which data are feasible, which methods are applicable for intelligent prediction of such data, and what are the available operations for prediction, this paper offers a new deep learning approach called bi-directional isometric-gated recurrent unit (BDIGRU). It is merged to the deep learning framework of neural networks for predictive analysis of travel time and business adoption for route planning. The proposed new method directly learns high-level features from big traffic data and reconstructs them by its own attention mechanism drawn by temporal orders to complete the learning process recursively in an end-to-end manner. After deriving the computational algorithm with stochastic gradient descent, we use the proposed method to perform predictive analysis of stochastic travel time under various traffic conditions (especially for congestions) and then determine the optimal vehicle route with the shortest travel time under future uncertainty. Based on empirical results with big traffic data, we show that the proposed BDIGRU method can (1) significantly improve the predictive accuracy of one-step 30 min ahead travel time compared to several conventional (data-driven, model-driven, hybrid, and heuristics) methods measured with several performance criteria, and (2) efficiently determine the optimal vehicle route in relation to the predictive variability under uncertainty. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"We are at a turning point in the debate on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) because we are witnessing the rise of general-purpose AI text agents such as GPT-3 that can generate large-scale highly refined content that appears to have been written by a human. Yet, a discussion on the ethical issues related to the blurring of the roles between humans and machines in the production of content in the business arena is lacking. In this conceptual paper, drawing on agenda setting theory and stakeholder theory, we challenge the current debate on the ethics of AI and aim to stimulate studies that develop research around three new challenges of AI text agents: automated mass manipulation and disinformation (i.e., fake agenda problem), massive low-quality content production\\xa0(i.e., lowest denominator problem) and the creation of a growing buffer in the communication between stakeholders (i.e., the mediation problem). © 2022 The Authors.

       " '\"\"\"Fairness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) decisions has become a big challenge for governments, companies, and societies. We offer a theoretical contribution to consider AI ethics outside of high-level and top-down approaches, based on the distinction between “reality” and “world” from Luc Boltanski. To do so, we provide a new perspective on the debate on AI fairness and show that criticism of ML unfairness is “realist”, in other words, grounded in an already instituted reality based on demographic categories produced by institutions. Second, we show that the limits of “realist” fairness corrections lead to the elaboration of “radical responses” to fairness, that is, responses that radically change the format of data. Third, we show that fairness correction is shifting to a “domination regime” that absorbs criticism, and we provide some theoretical and practical avenues for further development in AI ethics. Using an ad hoc critical space stabilized by reality tests alongside the algorithm, we build a shared responsibility model which is compatible with the radical response to fairness issues. Finally, this paper shows the fundamental contribution of pragmatic sociology theories, insofar as they afford a social and political perspective on AI ethics by giving an active role to material actors such as database formats on ethical debates. In a context where data are increasingly numerous, granular, and behavioral, it is essential to renew our conception of AI ethics on algorithms in order to establish new models of responsibility for companies that take into account changes in the computing paradigm. © 2022, The Author(s).\"\"\"',\n",

This research paper explores the various technological advancements that will pave the way for the advent of 6G networks, with a particular focus on addressing energy consumption. It is widely recognized that energy efficiency plays a crucial role in the evolution of 6G networks. To enhance network performance, user experience, and resource management, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be a pivotal technology. AI-based solutions can effectively optimize energy usage and contribute to the overall efficiency of 6G networks. Furthermore, the incorporation of wireless communication systems, telecommunication, and the Internet of Things (IoT) will be integral to the infrastructure of 6G networks. The need for significant enhancements in 6G networks is also examined in this study. Ensuring the safety and protection of 6G networks from cyber threats becomes increasingly important due to the growing reliance on networked communication and the sensitive nature of transmitted information. Cutting-edge security methods such as homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology may be essential in this regard. Moreover, this research paper explores the impact of 6G networks on various domains and discusses the challenges that must be overcome to unlock the technology\\'s full potential. To ensure responsible adoption and usage of 6G networks, the development of new business models and regulatory frameworks may be necessary to support their implementation while addressing energy consumption concerns. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

       " '\"\"\"The introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and others has revolutionised the traditional warehousing and logistics industry, resulting in significant changes to various operations and decision-making. Despite the undeniable importance of this topic, the primary research on the impact of IoT technology is inconsistent and scattered. The present study aims to review state-of-art literature on the application of IoT technology in the warehousing and logistics field and suggests a path for the future research through an in-depth analysis of studies done in this area. Sixty-four research articles were carefully selected after a thorough search of the Scopus and EBSCO databases, covering the period from January 2011 to 07th December 2021, to examine the applications of the IoT in the warehousing and logistics business. These articles were thoroughly reviewed and classified in terms of year-wise distribution, major publication outlets, types of study, and highly cited papers to understand the evolution and ongoing trends in this field. The findings reveal that majority of the studies on IoT in the warehousing and logistics domain have been conducted in developed countries. While logistics has been widely investigated, studies on the warehousing domain are limited. Also, there is an under-presentation of various theories in IoT research. The study highlights various gaps by synthesising existing literature and provides a fertile ground for conducting future research in this domain. Supply chain practitioners and researchers will find this review timely and valuable, which offers several valuable implications for them. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\"\"',\n",

However, many organizations grapple with implementing AI solutions due to a lack of necessary infrastructure and mechanisms. In short, many companies are not adequately prepared to adopt AI. To make matters worse, the literature does not offer sufficient insights into this issue. To help address this issue, in this article, the authors explore what it means to become ‘AI-ready.’ Specifically, this study identifies the various dimensions of AI readiness through in-depth semi-structured interviews with top- and middle-level managers from 52 multinational corporations in Southeast Asia, primarily in India. This study employed a qualitative data analysis approach to construct a grounded theory model focusing on AI readiness. The methodology involved systematic examination and coding of data to identify key themes and patterns, enabling the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework. The findings suggest that AI readiness can be categorized into eight dimensions: informational, environmental, infrastructural, participants, process, customers, data, and technological readiness. This study makes a significant contribution to marketing, management, and information systems by conceptualizing the AI readiness construct and identifying its key dimensions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"Social media can help businesses and society implement sustainable practices (Bodin & Prell (Eds.), 2011). They also contribute to excessive resource use in data collection and sharing, digital resource use, and energy consumption (Kamin & Paireekreng, 2018). Thus, TikTok\\'s feeds consume 15.81 mAh per minute and emit 2.63 gEqCO2/min in 2021. (Derudder, 2021). The generation that uses this tool most (Burns-Stanning, 2020) is also the most demanding and aware of climate change issues (Knight, 2016), even though its practices contribute to the current degradation. This hiatus illustrates how difficult it is to reconcile individual and collective goals. We propose shifting the question from the end-user to the service provider by detecting sobriety pits in data use and access to perpetuate or avoid disrupting end-user practices. Sobriety (frugality) is a critical variable in energy transition scenarios (Balzani, 2019) and one of the ecological transition\\'s pillars. Social media and AI are particularly tense on these issues (Stein, 2020). Current solutions often pit energy efficiency against performance (Ikhlasse, Benjamin, Vincent & Hicham, 2021). Given the industry\\'s promises of information access, automation, intelligent decision-making, human error avoidance, and more, this is unacceptable. Thus, we propose an operational framework to pose a model of sobriety for data access, consumption, and use (such as in social media or AI agents training) that does not impair performance or accuracy. © the authors, 2023.

       " '\"\"\"Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have become a common tool in business and research over the past years. Models, for example, assist our decisions on which hotel to book or set the optimal price for a flight ticket based on real-time demand, and recommendation apps advise us where to eat or which sights are worth seeing. However, not all decisions taken by automated systems are easily understandable by human beings. How can one make sure that the model does not encompass unwanted bias or discriminate clients? How can one explain to the CEO that the price should be less than what the concurrence proposes? Fortunately, ML models that are explainable do indeed exist, and there is also active research on how to make unexplainable models interpretable. The most popular methods involve Lime and Shapley values, allowing researchers to identify the importance of the input variables and, in turn, to add an interpretation to the model prediction. In this regard, this chapter will describe how to use interpretability tools with ML models and will also provide intuition on the usefulness and limitations of these tools. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\"\"',\n",

A significantly underestimated source is the Sun, even when providing 1 percent of its total radiated energy to the Earth, powers a large fraction of the energy needs of nations. Several nations have spearheaded efforts towards this over the years and established solar panel infrastructures, but still needs expansion and motivation to progress. Since the advent of space technology with the Space Race and culminating into the rise of risk-tolerant nanosatellite constellations to replace monolithic large satellites with capability to perform a plethora of operations with diverse applications, ranging from Earth Observation and Navigation to new applications such as space-based Power beaming. A strategic innovative cost-effective solution to execute the COP26 and Glasgow Summit Pact outcomes is the establishment of a network of COTS small satellites using AI, active thermal control, LASER and MASER to beam Solar Power harvested from space, to direct the energy to solar panels at night, thereby utilizing existing infrastructures to generate more renewable energy and decrease the carbon footprint of all participating nations significantly for remote power reception facilities located at regions with minimal access to ground-based electricity resources. This work utilizes a previously designed and validated small satellite configuration, has designed and validated the multi-altitude multi-inclination LEO Sun-synchronous Polar orbits and flower constellation for 5 year operation using GMAT and Taitus for optimum beaming with least distance, maximum hover time, maximum coverage area, minimized drag for maximum mission life, contact opportunities and in conjunction an assessment of energy economics of all nations and simulations have revealed a significant increase of power production with the passes and eclipse duration.

To bridge these gaps, we integrate resource orchestration and knowledge-based view theoretical perspectives to develop a novel structural model examining antecedents to SCR and AI adoption, considering AI adoption as a pivot for facilitating SCR. The structural equation modelling technique was employed on the data collected from 280 Vietnamese manufacturing SMEs’ operations managers. Our results demonstrate that leadership will drive AI adoption by creating a data-driven, digital and conducive culture, and strengthening employee skills and competencies. Furthermore, AI adoption positively influences CE practices, SC agility and risk management, which will help to achieve SCR. For managers, the importance of internal organisational employee-centric mechanisms to create value from AI adoption without impeding business value is highlighted.

       " '\"\"\"This study investigates the enhancement of technological and strategic enablers for carbon-neutral businesses (CNB) through artificial intelligence (AI)-driven business model innovation (AIDBMI). Drawing upon the insights gained from the literature review, the study employs structural equation modeling (partial least squares structural equation modeling [PLS-SEM]) as the methodology to examine the relationships between AIDBMI, technological enablers, strategic enablers, and the attainment of carbon neutrality. The sample size consists of 326 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States of America. The findings of this study affirm the significant positive relationships between AIDBMI and both technological and strategic enablers for CNB. The utilization of AI technologies proves to be instrumental in fostering the development and implementation of innovative business models that integrate sustainability practices and address environmental challenges. By leveraging AIDBMI, SMEs can harness technological advancements to adopt energy-efficient processes, embrace renewable energy solutions, and implement effective carbon reduction strategies. Moreover, the study highlights the critical role of strategic enablers in driving the transition towards carbon neutrality. The alignment of sustainability goals with organizational strategies, stakeholder collaboration, and employee engagement emerge as pivotal factors in enabling SMEs to effectively utilize AIDBMI and leverage technological advancements to achieve carbon neutrality. The implications of this study contribute to the existing literature by highlighting the importance of technological and strategic enablers in creating CNB. By integrating AIDBMI, organizations can drive sustainable transformations, optimize their operations, and align their resource management with sustainable practices.

       " '\"\"\"Interpretability is a pressing issue for decision systems. Many post hoc methods have been proposed to explain the predictions of a single machine learning model. However, business processes and decision systems are rarely centered around a unique model. These systems combine multiple models that produce key predictions, and then apply rules to generate the final decision. To explain such decisions, we propose the Semi-Model-Agnostic Contextual Explainer (SMACE), a new interpretability method that combines a geometric approach for decision rules with existing interpretability methods for machine learning models to generate an intuitive feature ranking tailored to the end user. We show that established model-agnostic approaches produce poor results on tabular data in this setting, in particular giving the same importance to several features, whereas SMACE can rank them in a meaningful way. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\"\"',\n",

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT\\'s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT\\'s use should be restricted or legislated.

The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts. © 2023 The Authors\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming fundamental in almost all activity sectors in our society. However, most of the modern AI techniques (e.g., Machine Learning – ML) have a black box nature, which hinder their adoption by practitioners in many application fields. This issue raises a recent emergence of a new research area in AI called Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), aiming at providing AI-based decision-making processes and outcomes to be easily understood, interpreted, and justified by humans. Since 2018, there has been an exponential growth of research studies on XAI, which has justified some review studies. However, these reviews currently focus on proposing taxonomies of XAI methods. Yet, XAI is by nature a highly applicative research field, and beyond XAI methods, it is also very important to investigate how XAI is concretely used in industries, and consequently derive the best practices to follow for better implementations and adoptions. There is a lack of studies on this latter point. To fill this research gap, we first propose a holistic review of business applications of XAI, by following the Theory, Context, Characteristics, and Methodology (TCCM) protocol. Based on the findings of this review, we secondly propose a methodological and theoretical framework in six steps that can be followed by all practitioners or stakeholders for improving the implementation and adoption of XAI in their business applications. We particularly highlight the need to rely on domain field and analytical theories to explain the whole analytical process, from the relevance of the business question to the robustness checking and the validation of explanations provided by XAI methods. Finally, we propose seven important future research avenues. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Maritime navigation in the Arctic Ocean is fraught with danger such as strong atmospheric electromagnetic interference, adverse weather conditions, unreliable satellite signal and coverage. A vessel not knowing its position while navigating in the Arctic may find itself in a critical situation. In the framework of the 2nd CASSINI Hackathon aimed to promote ideas based on safe passage in the Arctic, the authors developed a product called North Star. The aim of North Star is using Earth Observation data provided by Galileo and Copernicus services to improve navigation in the Arctic. It consists of an on-board neural engine, the AI Pilot, which searches for and identifies a safe route for the user. The neural engine can be trained on the Copernicus data from the Sentinel constellation, which includes information such as ice thickness, iceberg distribution, wind speed direction, and wave height for a specific passage. In the event of a satellite signal loss, the AI Pilot reuses the information received from Galileo up to that point and integrates them with the vessel\\'s own maritime sensors to maintain the viability of the projected route. The idea behind the AI Pilot is that when a vessel is within communication range with other North Star vessels, they form an ad-hoc mesh network of data collectors with edge computing capabilities. The creation of a mesh network can provide augmented data to the entire GNSS ecosystem. While shipping transportation of oil and gas across the Arctic passages undergoes more strict regulations, private tourism and charter yacht operators in the Arctic are an emerging market due to the relatively unsafe travel conditions. North Star can have a beneficial impact on the tourist sector in the first place, extending afterwards to support Search and Rescue operations, as well as contributing to the protection of the environment and the Arctic fauna. This research presents the concept of operations of North Star, as well as its high-level description from the technical perspective. The potential of this business case is further investigated, to include a roadmap of services offered until the return of investment, potential customers, and current competitors.

       " '\"\"\"The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) introduces openness and intelligence into the existing, tightly-coupled RAN ecosystem. Openness promotes collaboration among various vendors to provide diverse components (hardware, software, or both) for the RAN ecosystem, while intelligence handles complex network activities using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although O-RAN design addresses many issues in traditional RANs, such as vendor lock-in, lack of flexibility, and limited innovation, it raises several management and security concerns related to collaboration, access management, privacy, trust, and availability. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) offer a viable method of establishing trust among entities, managing resources efficiently, and automating complex network tasks. Several DLT properties, such as distributed architecture, high automation through smart contracts, immutability, and transparency, could position DLT-based ideas as game changers in a multi-vendor O-RAN ecosystem. Furthermore, this technology has the potential to introduce new business models and establish secure and trusted micro-payments among vendors and network participants.

       " '\"\"\"Taxonomies are crucial for executing Business Intelligence (BI) applications by preventing users from being overwhelmed with information. The business applications require knowledge of the key concepts and their organization to perform the classification of news articles. To ensure and maintain reliable information classification quality, it is crucial to keep the same definitions and organization of these concepts. This indicates the major significance of BI taxonomies in organizations. However, their development in business information systems follows an ad hoc process in most cases. Compared to many other domains, e.g. environmental and life sciences research, no mature and updated BI taxonomies are available in the literature. Existing studies cover BI taxonomies, but these are excessively generic and domain-specific. As a result, the BI domain suffers from many immature, incorrect, and incomplete notions of concepts. New BI-related concepts emerge rapidly, making it essential to include them in existing taxonomies during the enrichment process. The contribution of our research is the exploration of the possibilities of taxonomy enrichment using existing datasets. The expansion of the existing business taxonomy using multifaceted data sources to capture new concepts comprising 1) lexical datasets, 2) pre-trained word embeddings, 3) linked open data vocabulary, and 4) corpus-based relevant thematic extraction of features from news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The highest semantic enrichment rate of a taxonomy got on a combination of these 4 methods.

       " '\"\"\"We present two constraints that partition the vertices of an undirected n-vertex, m-edge graph g=(V,ε)into a set of vertex-disjoint trees. The first is the resource-forest constraint, where we assume that a subset R⊆V of the vertices are resource vertices. The constraint specifies that each tree in the forest must contain at least one resource vertex. This is the natural undirected counterpart of the tree constraint (Beldiceanu et al., CP-AI-OR\\'05, Springer, Berlin, 2005), which partitions a directed graph into a forest of directed trees where only certain vertices can be tree roots. We describe a hybrid-consistency algorithm that runs in O(m+n)time for the resource-forest constraint, a sharp improvement over the O(mn) bound that is known for the directed case. The second constraint is proper-forest. In this variant, we do not have the requirement that each tree contains a resource, but the forest must contain only proper trees, i.e., trees that have at least two vertices each. We develop a hybrid-consistency algorithm for this case whose running time is O(mn)in the worst case, and O(m√n) in many (typical) cases. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.\"\"\"',\n",

The conceptual approach allows us to identify some research streams (e.g. co-working collaborations in supply chain management) by proposing a matrix that helps clarify the analysis\\'s directions. Findings: The results show the importance of AI that can help the operator in accessing supplier information, including current prices, available stocks, and delivery status, thereby reducing the risk of information asymmetry. AI is intended not only as a technology tool but also as an innovative solution to promote business relationships and support vertical alliances through the value chain between buyer and supplier. Originality/value: This paper can help healthcare actors examine the choices behind their operational strategies by providing transparency of the activities and availability of information in real-time. Finally, our study reflects the future directions to enhance the cooperation and innovation adoption among healthcare operators. © 2022, Chiara Cannavale, Anna Esempio Tammaro, Daniele Leone and Francesco Schiavone.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Given the increasingly significant role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the global economy and the ever more competitive markets in which these companies operate, SMEs’ ability to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is of utmost importance. Due to constantly evolving social, environmental, and technological scenarios, the managers of these firms must increasingly focus on incorporating new tools such as AI into SME operations in order to enjoy their benefits. However, the subjectivity and complexity of this adaptation process makes integrated analyses of key factors challenging. The present study sought to develop a multi-criteria decision-support system that applies cognitive mapping and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique in a neutrosophic context. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of previous studies and models by structuring the decision problem and identifying and understanding which factors should be central to adaptation initiative analyses. A panel of experts in AI were recruited to facilitate the construction of an analysis system that takes into account indeterminacy in decision-making processes. The results were validated by both the panel members and project managers at COTEC Portugal—a leading think-and-action network that seeks to advance technology diffusion and business innovation cooperation. The proposed system’s practical implications and benefits are also analyzed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Machine Learning (ML) based data analytics provide methods to cope with the massive data amounts, generated by the various manufacturing processes. In this respect, the maintenance is among the most critical activities concerned by the industrial data analytics in the contexts of industry 4.0. We believe that the maintenance activities can be managed by the predictive processes dwelling on ML methods with the help of meta-learning based data analytics solutions. The challenge is then to facilitate the industry 4.0 actors, who are supposedly not AI specialists, with the application of machine learning. The automated machine learning seems to be the area dealing with this challenge. In this paper, we first show the problematic of assisting industry 4.0 actors to implement ML algorithms in the context of predictive maintenance. We then present a novel AutoML based framework. It aims to enable industry 4.0 actors and researchers, who presumably have limited competencies in machine learning, to generate ML-based data analytics solutions and their deployment in the manufacturing workflows. The framework implements primarily the approaches based on the meta-learning for this purpose. In the context of Industry 4.0 such approaches lead to the implementation of the smart factory concepts. It makes the factory processes more proactive on the basis of predictive knowledge extracted from the various manufacturing devices, sensors, and business processes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\"\"',\n",

To have a sustainable vision of their business, firms need to have a suitable decision-making process at each stage, including minute details. Our study reviews and investigates the existing research in the field of decision support systems (DSSs) and how artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have been integrated into OR. The findings of our review show how AI has contributed to decision making in the operations research field. This review presents synergies, differences, and overlaps in AI, DSSs, and OR. Furthermore, a clarification of the literature based on the approaches adopted to develop the DSS is presented along with the underlying theories. The classification has been primarily divided into two categories, i.e. theory building and application-based approaches, along with taxonomies based on the AI, DSS, and OR areas. In this review, past studies were calibrated according to prognostic capability, exploitation of large data sets, number of factors considered, development of learning capability, and validation in the decision-making framework. This paper presents gaps and future research opportunities concerning prediction and learning, decision making and optimization in view of intelligent decision making in today’s era of uncertainty.

       " '\"\"\"The aim of this study was to evaluate antitumor effects of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in breast carcinoma and their ability to act synergistically with aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients without previous adjuvant AI treatment received exemestane 25 mg/days plus either celecoxib 400 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression- free survival (PFS). This trial was prematurely terminated (N = 157 of 342 planned) after cardiovascular toxicity was reported in other celecoxib trials. Although no PFS difference was observed between the two arms (9.8 months for both, P = 0.72), a trend favoring celecoxib was observed in 60 tamoxifen-resistant patients (9.6 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.14) and in 126 patients treated ≥3 months before study termination (12.2 vs. 9.8 months; P = 0.09). No severe adverse events were reported. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors seemingly contribute to reverse endocrine resistance in breast cancer patients, although further study is necessary to allow development of a new therapeutic strategy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"Companies need the data from multiple sources for analysis and to find meaning in deriving valuable business insights. Online news articles are one of the main data sources that present up-to-date business news offered by various companies in the market. Topic modeling, i.e. a key player in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, helps businesses to drive value from news articles. Also, it supports the extraction of business insights from news articles to facilitate the identification of trends (topics) in the market and their evolution over time. These insights can help businesses not only automate routine tasks but also in building new marketing policies, decision-making, and customer support. It is also important to find the linked semantic information (i.e. key persons, organizations, or regions called named entities) involved in generating these topics for the identification of news sources. This paper presents the application of a hybrid approach based on dynamic topic modeling and Named-Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting business trends along with the related entities. To show the functionality of the proposed approach, the news articles collected from the websites that published the content related to company interests were from 2017 to 2021 inclusive. The proposed approach can serve as the foundation for future exploratory trend analysis to study the evolution of information not only in the business domain but also applicable in other domains.

With the prodigious technological leap made in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years, disruptive innovations have affected many business sectors, with economic, social and ethical consequences. But what do people really want about the application of artificial intelligence technologies in the law system? This article presents a general methodological approach to take into account the ethical aspect of the introduction of a new technology in a given domain. We apply this methodology in the specific case of the introduction of AI technologies in the law system. As a multidisciplinary working group interested in this application in the case of France, we have organized a series of workshops to discuss this topic and highlight the respective values and interests of each stakeholder.

       " '\"\"\"The supply chain performance depends on accurate demand forecasting. This becomes more critical when it comes to non-contract spare parts service supply chains. This is because of the fact that customers are not obliged to place an order for the required spare parts to its Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) due to the availability of multiple suppliers. The business aircraft spare parts supply chains are the ones most affected by this phenomenon because their travel pattern and usage is totally unpredictable in comparison with passenger airline carriers. These highly uncertain and unpredictable demands and subsequent inaccurate forecasts have severe financial consequences. It is also computationally expensive to predict demand forecast for each part due to huge number of spare parts in business aircraft\\'s supply chain. Hence, in this paper the objective is to investigate forecasting methods, their variants and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, developed for irregular demands, to propose best method variant that is capable of accurately forecasting not only uncertain but unpredictable demand e.g. business aircraft\\'s spare parts supply chain. We retained Boot Strapping (BS) method as the most suitable base method for uncertain and unpredictable demand forecasting. This is because of its inherent ability to reduce error due to resampling with replacement. The point and interval (existing), and sliding window (proposed) BS methods are implemented in Matlab and results of demand forecasts are compared with the forecasts generated from benchmarked existing forecasting methods as: Croston, Croston variants (SBJ, SNB, TSB), moving average (MA), single exponential smoothening (SES) and Commercial (proprietary black box) methods. The data used in this study is collected from Dassault Aviation. The results demonstrate that proposed sliding windows BS variant with ‘Mean’ function outperformed 75% of the spare parts with significant financial gains in terms of inventory holding and shortage costs. © 2017\"\"\"',\n",

The present work analyzes the dust aerosol patterns over the arid environment of the Sistan region in southeastern Iran, by means of multiple satellite platforms aiming to reveal the spatio-temporal distribution and trends. The dataset includes records of Aerosol Index (AI) from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) (1978-2001) and 6-year AI records from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard Aura. Moreover, the aerosol optical depth is analyzed through 11-year records from Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard Terra (2000-2010) and from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2002-2011). The main focus is to determine the similarities and differences in dust variability over southwest Asia, in general, and the Sistan region, in particular. The results show a marked seasonal cycle with high aerosol loading during summer and lower in winter, while MISR, MODIS, and TOMS/OMI observations agree in both terms of monthly and seasonally mean spatial and temporal patterns. The higher aerosol concentrations during summer are interpreted as a result of the combined effect of the seasonal drying of the Hamoun lakes and the strong northerly Levar winds favoring dust erosion from the alluvial deposits in Sistan. After prolonged drought period, the dust aerosol load over the area has increased in the beginning of the 2000 s and decreased after 2004, thereby leading to an overall declining trend during the last decade. Such a trend is absent during the winter period when dust emission over the region is minimal. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\"\"\"',\n",

As a biological trait, HDL-C is strongly genetically determined, with a heritability index ranging from 40% to 60%. HDL represents an appealing therapeutic target due to its beneficial pleiotropic effects in preventing CHD. This review focuses on the genetic basis of cellular cholesterol efflux, the rate-limiting step in HDL biogenesis. There are several monogenic disorders (e.g., Tangier disease, caused by mutations within ABCA1) affecting HDL biogenesis. Importantly, many disorders of cellular cholesterol homeostasis cause a reduced HDL-C. We integrate information from family studies and linkage analyses with that derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and review the recent identification of micro-RNAs (miRNA) involved in cellular cholesterol metabolism. The identification of genomic pathways related to HDL may help pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches to promote cellular cholesterol efflux as a therapeutic modality to prevent atherosclerosis. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) promotes the reuse of loosely coupled and distributed entities, namely services, and their automatic composition into value-added applications. An issue in SOC is to fulfill this promise with the development of models and algorithms supporting composition in an automatic (and automated) way, generating business processes from a set of available services and composition requirements, e.g., descriptions of end-user needs or business goals. Within the context of the widely accepted service-oriented architecture, i.e., Web services, this issue is currently known as the Web Service Composition (WSC) problem. WSC has been widely addressed in the past few years [15]. AI planning is increasingly applied to WSC due to its support for automatic composition from under-specified requirements [19]. An AI planning based algorithm usually provides a one-time solution, i.e., a plan, for a composition request. However, in the real and open world, change occurs frequently. Services may appear and disappear at any time in a unpredictable way, e.g., due to failure or the user mobility when services get out of reach. Service disappearance requires changing the original plan, and may cause some goals to be unreachable. End-user needs or business goals may also change over time. For example, one may want to add sightseeing functionality to a composition when arrived at a trip destination. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\"\"\"',\n",

Both lead to drastic changes facing artificial intelligence (AI), cryptocurrencies and block-chain technologies, internet of things, technology-based surveillance, and other disruptive innovations. These developments facilitate the rise of the sharing economy and open for a variety of new entrepreneurial opportunities that businesses can take up. The novel entrepreneurial opportunities, however, imply a paradigmatic shift in the understanding of entrepreneurship. This book combines digital entrepreneurship with the sharing economy. It presents cutting-edge research for scholars and practitioners interested in either one of the topics - digital entrepreneurship or sharing economy - or their connection. The book addresses three major ways to become entrepreneurial in the sharing economy: digital entrepreneurship through creating novel sharing-economy platforms; technology entrepreneurship through the exploitation of sharing-economy platforms; and business model innovation or business model change influenced by the sharing economy. The book also highlights governance questions on digital entrepreneurship in the sharing economy, which are highly relevant for businesses, the economy, and society.

Often, the state space to be searched is huge, so optimizing the search is an important issue. In this paper, we consider the problem of visiting all states in the setting where transitions between states are generated by actions, and the (reachable) states are not known in advance. Some of the actions may commute, i.e., they result in the same state for every order in which they are taken.

       " '\"\"\"Enedis is the main power distribution system operator in France. With a network of 1.4 million km, it spends several hundred million Euros every year to maintain the existing network. Enedis is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to choose which parts of the network have to be renewed. The general approach of the targeting method presented in this paper was initially developed for underground Low Voltage (LV) networks and has been successfully used for three years. However, it could not be directly applied to the Medium Voltage (MV) network due to its different structure, with fewer but much longer feeders. MV network reliability is even more critical since faults on this network usually have a bigger impact on power supply. In order to fit some machine learning models on a portion of the network which has a size relevant for renewal investment, it has been necessary to develop complex data analytics, such as graph calculation, to get the useful features to train the models. The technologies used for data preparation allows the solution to be scaled up after successful tests on smaller dataset. We estimate that this new method applied over a three years period increases the number of faulty cables identified by 60%, compared to the current business as usual targeting method.

This was a 6-month, prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients who had discontinued anastrozole due to musculoskeletal symptoms were eligible to participate in this study, and received letrozole, which was initiated 1 month after anastrozole discontinuation. Musculoskeletal symptoms were systematically assessed for severity, location of the symptoms, presence of swelling and of morning stiffness by the oncologist patients when patients stopped taking their anastrozole, 1 month after the discontinuation of anastrozole, and 1, 3, and 6 months after initiating the letrozole therapy. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who discontinued letrozole due to the severe musculoskeletal symptoms. After switching from anastrozole therapy, and at the end of the 6-month letrozole treatment, 128 (71.5%) out of 179 patients (61.3 ± 8.4 years) continued with letrozole. Fifty-one patients (28.5%) discontinued treatment due to severe joint pain. At the end of the 6-month, 116 patients (73.9%) had arthralgia, 33 (21.0%) myalgia, 25 (15.9%) arthritis, 22 (14.0%) tendinitis, and 20 (12.7%) polyalgic syndrome. Bivariate analysis of the factors associated with letrozole discontinuation showed that the duration of a prior anastrozole treatment was a significant predictor (P = 0.04). This study shows that in patients intolerant to one AI, switching to another agent allows a higher proportion of patients to continue the therapy and maximize hormonal adjuvant therapy and disease outcome benefits. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"The needs expressed by the Earth Observation market are evolving towards shorter revisit times, high reactivity and a higher variety of image products while keeping image resolutions high. Indeed, one or two satellites are not enough anymore to address applications relative to national security, disaster management or commercial monitoring. To answer these needs, Airbus put two satellite products on the market, the S250 optical and S250 radar. They are designed with constellations and complementarity in mind. An advanced ground segment ensures that customers can maximally exploit the great reactivity and huge acquisition capacity that come with a system combining several of these satellites. The paper describes one of the major implications of such constellations on the ground segment: the satellites can easily flood end users with image products of multiple types, therefore image analysis is necessary to automatically extract first level of information fast enough, allowing analysts to concentrate on their main skills and concerns. This way a decision can be made quickly whether to reprogram the constellation\\'s acquisition plans, potentially crosscueing between optical and radar observations. The paper goes into the topics Airbus has been working on for endowing its systems with operational capabilities of image analysis using AI technologies. Technical and programmatic questions must be treated in many areas: training of new Machine Learning algorithms and re-training of existing ones on the new sensor products, the qualification, monitoring and maintenance of the algorithms and of the end-products, the timeliness at which the end products must be produced, the alignment of products generated by optical and radar algorithms in view of feeding sensor agnostic analytics products, the standardisation of algorithm interfaces for future capability extensions, the sizing of the IT infrastructure.

IBN allows network operators to express an outcome or business objective without the low-level configurations necessary to program the network to achieve these demands. Existing research proposals for IBN introduce several systems to translate users intents into network infrastructure configurations. Despite the positive aspects of these proposals, they still suffer from many drawbacks. Some require users to learn a new intent definition language. Some others may lack the appropriate grammar to make these frameworks recognize the intent correctly. In this paper, we introduce a framework leveraging the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for network management from an operator utterances. In order to understand natural language, our framework uses the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning model based on recurrent neural networks (LSTM). The model has been improved by using word embedding and user feedback.

       " '\"\"\"The verification of control-flow soundness is well understood as an important step before deploying business process models. However, the control flow does not capture what the process activities actually do when they are executed. Semantic annotations offer the opportunity to take this into account. Inspired by semantic Web service approaches such as OWL-S and WSMO, we consider process models in which the individual activities are annotated with logical preconditions and effects, specified relative to an ontology that axiomatizes the underlying business domain. Verification then addresses the overall process behavior, arising from the interaction between control-flow and behavior of individual activities. To this end, we combine notions from the workflow community with notions from the AI actions and change literature. We introduce a formal execution semantics for annotated business processes. We point out four verification tasks that arise, concerning precondition/effect conflicts, reachability, and executability. We examine the borderline between classes of processes that can, or cannot, be verified in polynomial time. For precondition/effect conflicts, we show that the borderline is the same as that of the logic underlying the ontology axioms. For reachability and executability, we identify a class of processes that can be verified in polynomial time by a fixpoint algorithm which we design for that purpose. We show that this class of processes is maximal in the sense that, when generalizing it in any of the most relevant directions, the validation tasks become computationally hard. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\"\"\"',\n",

After having presented (Section I) some of the fundamental challenges which the financial services industry puts onto decision technology, the motivations for the use of AI are related to a number of typical applications (Section II). This translates into suitable development and delivery environments (Section III), and to generic domain utilities required from shells or customized systems for that industry (Section IV). Markets and trades (Section V) are then shown to be well described in terms of knowledge representation and data structures, by object-oriented features embedded into logic programming environments. Conflict resolution strategies (Section VI), preference aggregation (Section VII), and revealed beliefs (Section VIII) are studied in detail as they represent cornerstones of the reasoning strategies used. A formal analysis of investment decision criteria (Section IX) demonstrates the complexity hereof, even with the help of search; an example from currency risk management (Section X) exemplifies this, while also demonstrating that sophisticated solutions can be built.

Moreover, we discuss exciting new opportunities for integrated localization and sensing applications, which will disrupt traditional design principles and revolutionize the way we live, interact with our environment, and do business. Regarding potential enabling technologies, 6G will continue to develop towards even higher frequency ranges, wider bandwidths, and massive antenna arrays. In turn, this will enable sensing solutions with very fine range, Doppler, and angular resolutions, as well as localization to cm-level degree of accuracy. Besides, new materials, device types, and reconfigurable surfaces will allow network operators to reshape and control the electromagnetic response of the environment. At the same time, machine learning and artificial intelligence will leverage the unprecedented availability of data and computing resources to tackle the biggest and hardest problems in wireless communication systems. As a result, 6G will be truly intelligent wireless systems that will provide not only ubiquitous communication but also empower high accuracy localization and high-resolution sensing services. They will become the catalyst for this revolution by bringing about a unique new set of features and service capabilities, where localization and sensing will coexist with communication, continuously sharing the available resources in time, frequency, and space.

While AI-based marketing would be able to identify and target effectively high-value consumers, revenue management would be able to determine the right pricing strategy in real time due to the vast amount of available data and subsequently would have positive impact on the financial performance of the hospitality company. © 2021 Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"In this chapter, the author presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-based generic concept for decision making using data science. The applied holistic mathematical model for AI (AHMM4AI) focuses on data and access management. A decisive business decision in a business transformation process of a traditional business environment into an automated AI-based business environment is the capacity of the decision-making system and the profile of the business transformation manager (BTM, or simply the manager). The manager and his team are supported by a holistic framework. The role of data science and the needed data modelling techniques are essential for managing data models in a transformation project. For that reason, the development of the big data for AI (BGD4AI) is an essential start. © 2021, IGI Global.\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"Projections for coming entrepreneurial trends predict that artificial intelligence (AI) will be a thriving area for innovation; the evolution of the Internet of things will have more impact on the economy; the digital twin will take on vast importance, and Blockchain technology promises to change applications in government, healthcare, content distribution, and the supply chain (Cearley et al., 2017; Armstrong, 2018). These innovations, among other emerging entrepreneurial endeavors, will result in vast market disruption and innovation-driven growth; in Bower and Christensen’s (1995) terms, these trends encompass ‘disruptive innovation’. While the entrepreneurial landscape is fraught with constant bursts of innovation that reciprocally propel development of progressive modes of production, technology and business dynamics, entrepreneurship education (EE) does not reflect these innovations. The expectation is that EE will provide the relevant entrepreneurial-driven knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs), along with agile, creative mindsets and other psychological aspects (for example, self-effacement, motivation, intentions) to enable the implementation of such innovations into a viable, entrepreneurial business. However, research shows that EE for adult entrepreneurs still pursues conservative models, rather than forward-looking ones. This discrepancy between entrepreneurship and EE is echoed throughout the program types: the market is witnessing a gigantic outpouring of enabling systems (Matlay, 2006, 2008; Politis, 2005; Winkler et al., 2018), such as incubators, accelerators, academic programs for entrepreneurs, co-working spaces, corporate-based innovation centers, impact hubs, scaling accelerators, and digital accelerators, among others, but this substantial flux brings with it the question of relevant preparation for the entrepreneurial journey. The massively growing number of programs seems confusing to the learner-entrepreneurs, who need to determine which program will fit their needs as well as those of their stakeholders (Bischoff et al., 2018; Kariv et al., 2018; Steiner et al., 2018). Taken together, while entrepreneurship is characterized by vast innovation and boosted developments, the consequent implementation performance, which is attained through EE, is lagging behind due to the existing conventional EE modalities. These incongruities are the impetus for this book’s undertaking: to bring fresh views and perspectives on these prevailing gaps by illustrating innovative pedagogies and innovative programs through research studies, springing from an array of academic approaches, from various countries and various entrepreneurship programs. Specifically, this book aims to bridge some of the existing and evolving gaps between the entrepreneurship landscape and EE, to introduce a ‘disruptive innovation’-based look into EE, thus providing the groundwork for a better, more vigorous fit between the learners’ needs and EE focuses. This book offers new concepts and cases embodying EE and entrepreneurship learning (EL) in different countries, thereby covering a wide range of educational undertakings for entrepreneurs. The book aims to provide convergent, rather than divergent, perspectives on EE and EL. It sets out to deliver a constructive and focused research and learning agenda that closely matches the education and learning needs of nascent entrepreneurs and the corresponding programs that are being offered at all levels of the educational system. © Alain Fayolle, Dafna Kariv and Harry Matlay 2019.

       " '\"\"\"For more than decades, the central drivers of business growth have been technological tools. The most important of these is Artificial Intelligence (AI). We name the paradigm “Business Artificial Intelligence (BAI)” the category of AI approaches that can create profitable new business models, earnest business-values, and more competitiveness, particularly Machine Learning (ML). However, ML algorithms are plentiful, and most of them necessitate specific Data structures, particular applicability features, and in-depth analysis of the business context. Because of these considerations, an increasing number of industrial ML-based applications fail. Therefore, it is natural to ask the question of applicability limits and ML algorithms selection, giving the business context. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose the evidence of the “No-Free-Lunch” (NFL) theorems to understand ML use’s applicability in business organizations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Industrial Data Analytics\\xa0(IDA) provide methods and tools to cope with the vast amounts of data. The big industrial data is generated continuously during the execution of manufacturing processes. Hence, the predictive maintenance is among the most critical activities of the manufacturing processes concerned by the IDA. We believe that the maintenance activity can be managed by using Machine Learning\\xa0(ML) methodologies, especially the data analytics solutions based on meta-learning. The challenge is then to facilitate the application of ML by the industry 4.0 actors, who are supposedly not AI specialists. The automated machine learning\\xa0(AutoML) seems to be the area dealing with this challenge. In this paper, we primarily discuss the challenges of assisting industry 4.0 actors to implement ML algorithms in the context of predictive maintenance. Later on, we present a novel AutoML based framework for the industry 4.0 actors and researchers, who presumably have limited expertise in ML domain. It aims to enable them to generate ML-based data analytics solutions and deploy these solutions in manufacturing workflows. Specifically, the framework implements the approaches based on meta-learning and uses the web semantic concepts in this regard. In the context of Industry 4.0 such approaches lead to the implementation of the smart factory concepts. It makes the factory processes more proactive on the basis of predictive knowledge extracted from the various manufacturing devices, sensors, and business processes in real-time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (HRM) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"The enormous impact of artificial intelligence has been realized in transforming the fashion and apparel industry in the past decades. However, the research in this domain is scattered and mainly focuses on one of the stages of the supply chain. Due to this, it is difficult to comprehend the work conducted in the distinct domain of the fashion and apparel industry. Therefore, this paper aims to study the impact and the significance of artificial intelligence in the fashion and apparel industry in the last decades throughout the supply chain. Following this objective, we performed a systematic literature review of research articles (journal and conference) associated with artificial intelligence in the fashion and apparel industry. Articles were retrieved from two popular databases \\'Scopus\\' and \\'Web of Science\\' and the article screening was completed in five phases resulting in 149 articles. This was followed by article categorization which was grounded on the proposed taxonomy and was completed in two steps. First, the research articles were categorized according to the artificial intelligence methods applied such as machine learning, expert systems, decision support system, optimization, and image recognition and computer vision. Second, the articles were categorized based on supply chain stages targeted such as design, fabric production, apparel production, and distribution. In addition, the supply chain stages were further classified based on business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) to give a broader outlook of the industry. As a result of the categorizations, research gaps were identified in the applications of AI techniques, at the supply chain stages and from a business (B2B/B2C) perspective. Based on these gaps, the future prospects of the AI in this domain are discussed. These can benefit the researchers in academics and industrial practitioners working in the domain of the fashion and apparel industry. © 2013 IEEE.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"By Big Data Analytics we understand new technologies and methods that go beyond how data and analytics was previously handled. On the data side, extremely large data sets can be stored and processed, even real-time, and at reasonable cost. On the analytical side, methods are no longer limited to hard-coded (business) rules or statistics, but leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and particularly Machine Learning (ML). In this paper we argue that Big Data\\'s quickest business wins and first tangible impact is in the domain of customer/consumer analytics, summarized as Digital Consumer Journey Analytics. Such journeys are constructed from people\\'s movement and navigational patterns in both the virtual and physical world; while individual data points are at first not very expressive, the picture created by continuous collection of ubiquitous data and their history, allows to unveil almost any identity profile. Under this increasingly digital environment, staying in the relevant set of consumers is of utmost importance for businesses. Big Data Analytics can support by, e. g., driving product and service design and customer experience improvements. However, there are increasing limitations to the possibilities of Big Data Analytics in consumer businesses, in particular Data Privacy and Data Ethics. Businesses have to deal with a growing appetite of legislation and prudential regulation, e. g., the EU GDPR. The challenge is to make data-driven offerings trusted in the digital age. In this paper we will illustrate the journey in an insurance business to grow successful Big Data Use Cases in Consumer Analytics and discuss Privacy by Design (PbD) and Private Enhancing Technologies (PET) as means to build trusted data-driven products and services. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"In many AI fields, one must face the problem of finding a solution that is as close as possible to a given configuration. This paper addresses this problem in a propositional framework. We introduce the decision problem distance-sat, which consists in determining whether a propositional formula admits a model that disagrees with a given partial interpretation on at most d variables. The complexity of distance-sat and of several restrictions of it are identified. Two algorithms based on the well-known Davis/Logemann/Loveland search procedure for the satisfiability problem sat are presented so as to solve distance-sat for CNF formulas. Their computational behaviors are compared with the ones offered by sat solvers on sat encodings of distance-sat instances. The empirical evaluation allows us to draw firm conclusions about the respective performances of the algorithms and to relate the difficulty of distance-sat with the difficulty of sat from the practical side. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.\"\"\"',\n",

It investigates how data intelligence and analytics improve decision-making processes in the public sector. A bibliometric analysis of a database containing 161 English-language articles published between 2017 and 2021 is performed, providing a map of the knowledge produced and disseminated in previous studies. It provides insights into key topics, citation patterns, publication activities, the status of collaborations between contributors over past studies, aggregated data intelligence, and analytics research contributions. The study provides a retrospective review of published content in the field of data intelligence and analytics. The findings indicate that field research has been concentrated mainly on emerging technologies\\' intelligence capabilities rather than on human–artificial intelligence in decision-making performance in the public sector. This study extends an ambidexterity theory in decision support, which enlightens how this ambidexterity can be encouraged and how it affects decision outcomes. The study emphasises the importance of the public sector adoption of data intelligence and analytics, as well as its efficiency. Furthermore, this study expands how researchers and practitioners interpret and understand data intelligence and analytics, AI, and big data for effective public sector decision-making. © 2021\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Pandemic events, particularly the current Covid-19 disease, compel organisations to re-formulate their day-to-day operations for achieving various business goals such as cost reduction. Unfortunately, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) making up more than 95% of all businesses is the hardest hit sector. This has urged SMEs to rethink their operations to survive through pandemic events. One key area is the use of new technologies pertaining to digital transformation for optimizing pandemic preparedness and minimizing business disruptions. This is especially true from the perspective of digitizing asset management methodologies in the era of Industry 4.0 under pandemic environments. Incidentally, human-centric approaches have become increasingly important in predictive maintenance through the exploitation of digital tools, especially when the workforce is increasingly interacting with new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things devices for condition monitoring in equipment maintenance services. In this research, we propose an AI-based human-centric decision support framework for predictive maintenance in asset management, which can facilitate prompt and informed decision-making under pandemic environments. For predictive maintenance of complex systems, an enhanced trust-based ensemble model is introduced to undertake imbalanced data issues. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is incorporated to exploit the tacit knowledge elucidated from subject matter experts for providing decision support. Evaluations with both benchmark and real-world databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for addressing imbalanced data issues in predictive maintenance tasks. In the real-world case study, an accuracy rate of 82% is achieved, which indicates the potential of the proposed framework in assisting business sustainability pertaining to asset predictive maintenance under pandemic environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) raises many expectations regarding its ability to profoundly transform health care delivery. There is an abundant literature on the technical performance of AI applications in many clinical fields (e.g. radiology, ophthalmology). This article aims to bring forward the importance of studying organizational readiness to integrate AI into health care delivery. Design/methodology/approach: The reflection is based on our experience in digital health technologies, diffusion of innovations and healthcare organizations and systems. It provides insights into why and how organizational readiness should be carefully considered. Findings: As an important step to ensure successful integration of AI and avoid unnecessary investments and costly failures, better consideration should be given to: (1) Needs and added-value assessment; (2) Workplace readiness: stakeholder acceptance and engagement; (3) Technology-organization alignment assessment and (4) Business plan: financing and investments. In summary, decision-makers and technology promoters should better address the complexity of AI and understand the systemic challenges raised by its implementation in healthcare organizations and systems. Originality/value: Few studies have focused on the organizational issues raised by the integration of AI into clinical routine. The current context is marked by a perplexing gap between the willingness of decision-makers and technology promoters to capitalize on AI applications to improve health care delivery and the reality on the ground, where it is difficult to initiate the changes needed to realize their full benefits while avoiding their negative impacts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"Nonlinear optimal perturbations leading to subcritical transition with minimum threshold energy are searched in the plane Poiseuille flow at Re = 1500. To this end we proceed in two steps. First a family of optimally growing primary streaks U issued by the optimal vortices of the Poiseuille laminar solution is computed by direct numerical simulation for a set of finite amplitudes AI of the primary vortices. An adjoint technique is then used to compute the maximum growth and the finite time Lyapunov exponents of secondary perturbations growing on top of these primary base flows. The secondary optimals take into full account the non-normality and the local instabilities of the tangent operator all along the temporal evolution of the primary flows. The most amplified optimal perturbations are sinuous and realized in correspondence of streaks that are locally unstable. The combinations of primary and secondary perturbations optimal for transition are then explored using direct numerical simulations. It is shown that the minimum initial energy is realized by a large set of these combinations, revealing new paths to transition. Surprisingly we find that transition can be efficiently obtained even using secondary perturbations alone, in the absence of primary optimal vortices. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\"\"\"',\n",

The impacts of big data go beyond the commercial world, creating significant societal impact, from improving healthcare systems to the energy-efficient operation of cities and transportation infrastructure, to increasing the transparency and efficiency of public administration. In order to exploit the potential of big data to create value for society, citizens and businesses, Europe needs to embrace new technology, applications, use cases and business models within and across various sectors and domains. In the early part of the 2010s, a clear strategy centring around the notion of the European Big Data Value Ecosystem started to take form with the aim of increasing the competitiveness of European industries through a data ecosystem which tackles the fundamental elements of big data value, including the ecosystem, research and innovation, business, policy and regulation, and the emerging elements of data-driven AI and common European data spaces. This chapter describes the big data value ecosystem and its strategic importance. It details the challenges of creating this ecosystem and outlines the vision and strategy of the Big Data Value Public-Private Partnership and the Big Data Value Association, which together formed the core of the ecosystem, to make Europe the world leader in the creation of big data value.

       " '\"\"\"Recent literature suggests that there is considemble potential for reduction in the emission of C02 to the environment through the manufacture of new types of cement which do not rely on the calcination of limestone (and accompanying release of C02). The 1988 one billion metric tonnes world-wide production of cement accounted for one billion metric tonnes of C02 release, i.e. 5% of the 1988 world C02 emission (human activity only). This is equivalent to the C02 emission by the entire Japanese activity. The use of lesser amounts of calcium-based cements could be achieved through their pm1ial replacement by alkaliactivated alumino-silicate materials ,which do not release large quantities of C02 in their manufacture. The fostering of low-C02 high-alkali-based cements will mean a dramatic change in the research and development presently carried out in USA and other countries. Alkalis are generally thought of as the cause of deleterious alkali-aggregate-reaction. As a consequence, the tendency has been to avoid any addition of alkali por1land cement products , and often require the cement manufacturers to supply low-alkali cements. The use of MASNMR spectrography for the detcnninations of composition of alkali-activated cements, in combination with standard ASTM C 227 bar expansion, allows us to predict the potential for alkali-aggregate reaction. Our preliminary study involving 27 AI and 29Si MASNMR spectroscopy revealed that the alkali-activated alumino-silicate cements are the synthetic analogues of natural pozzolans which are known to effectively suppress the alkaliaggregate reaction. These cements, even with alkali contents as high as 9.2% do not generate any deleterious alkali-aggregate reaction, according to ASTM C 227 bar expansion test. Industrial experience based on the usc of alkali-activated slags in Eastern Europe since 1964, associated with the commercially produced alkali-activated cements in the US since 1988, suggest that high-alkali cements will ultimately improve the concrete used in buildings and highways, and also serve our global need by a) reducing the emission of C02 b) reducing the energy consumption during cement manufacturing. In terms of a 5% growth scenario, the predicted Business as Usual (BaU) world cement production for the year 2015 equals 35(X) million metric tonnes. Based on an amount of blended Pm1land cement production in the order of 1850 million metric tonnes (1000 Mt. Pm1land + 560 Mt. slag+ 290 Mt. fly ash), in the 21st century, the need for novel alkaliactivated cementitious materials could be in the range of 1650 million metric tonnes. © 1994 American Concrete Institute.

It is widely used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, topographic mapping, agricultural censuses and disaster prevention. However, traditional satellite remote sensing is subject to high cost and long data acquisition cycles, and it is difficult for users to get the data in time. These problems result in insufficient data supply capacity of remote sensing satellites, which leads to difficulties in supporting daily business applications and establishing a fast-growing business model business models. The small satellite segment has seen rapid market growth and technological advancements since 2013 following the multiple successful launches, most notably the Planet, Spire and others. Economies of scale during production are one of the core advantages of the small satellites segment, thus allowing for significant cost reduction throughout their development and production cycles. At the same time, big data analysis and the artificial intelligence (AI) industries are booming. Periodically full coverage data from small satellites provides a data source for data mining and periodic statistics for a wide range of targets. It provides huge opportunities and extension channels for the applications of big data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in Earth observation (EO). The present paper describes research on the technical and commercial increment of the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. In the first section of the paper, a literature review of the common downstream space activities along with identifying the limitations of Earth Observation in terms of high cost and long data acquisition cycles is presented. In the second section, the paper outlines a 4G case study to show that how the improvement of infrastructure brings new application scenarios, verticals and consumers. In the third section, the paper considers the possible new market opportunities of the 5G technology in the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO.

In previous works, three different layers were defined to be responsible of the cyber physical security of any given system: the network layer, the device layer and the human factor layer. However, statistics and experience have proven that the third factor is the weakest link in the cyber security of any company. This factor is divided into two subsections: the ignorance of the user (which will be treated in this paper) and the malignancy of the user. As the two previous layers were presented in previous works, this paper will focus on enhancing security by raising the cyber awareness of users thus creating a human firewall. For that, an AI-based conversational bot that focuses on cyber threat awareness and acts as a personal assistant relating to security issues was developed. This bot is based on AI-approach and it is used to make the interaction with the user appealing and friendly through the use of WhatsApp as a mean of communication.

       " '\"\"\"During the past 70+ years of research and development in the domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) we observe three principal, historical waves: embryonic, embedded and embodied AI. As the first two waves have demonstrated huge potential to seed new technologies and provide tangible business results, we describe likely developments of embodied AI in the next 25-35 years. We postulate that the famous Turing Test was a noble goal for AI scientists, making key, historical inroads - while we believe that Biological Systems Intelligence and the Insect/Swarm Intelligence analogy/mimicry, though largely disregarded, represents the key to further developments. We describe briefly the key lines of past and ongoing research, and outline likely future developments in this remarkable field. © 2013 IEEE.\"\"\"',\n",

The MORPHEMIC project proposes a unique way of adapting and optimizing cloud computing applications by introducing the novel concepts of polymorphic architecture and proactive adaptation. It allows application adaptation based on forecasted usage, number of users and other business metrics. The applications will be automatically reconfigured based on forecasting future needs. Also, the architecture of the applications can be changed, to better utilize available hardware. The MORPHEMIC User Interfaces include the tools available for the user to access all MORPHEMIC Platform features for cross-cloud applications modeled in CAMEL language to manage cloud deployment, optimization and monitoring. The User Interface acts as a central MORPHEMIC element where the execution task of applications deployment and the polymorphic adaptation is implemented by the Web User Interface Client which includes managing heterogeneous resources such as cloud offers and material accelerators, managing CAMEL Models, optimizing, deploying and monitoring the cross-cloud Application. The developed User Interface takes into consideration the quality of the User eXperience and the use case studies requirements as they represent the first users of the MORPHEMIC Platform.  © 2021 The Authors.\"\"\"',\n",

This leads to more attractions on control charts as one of the useful tools that contribute to the success in SM by anomaly detection (AD) approach. Coefficient of variation (CV) is a recent popular statistic that is used in the quality control of SM. In this paper, we propose investigating the performance of Cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts monitoring CV with a fast initial response (FIR) strategy. The chart parameters are also optimized according to the random shift size in a given interval with the proposed Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. The numerical results show that the performance of FIR CUSUM-γ2 charts are greater than the initial CUSUM-γ2 ones. An example in monitoring yarn quality at the spinning mill with the design of FIR CUSUM-γ2 charts is also proposed. These findings are useful for practitioners as well as managers and researchers. The proposed design of FIR CUSUM-γ2 charts could be applied in other processes of various domains such as finance, business, industrial processes, etc. © 2022 The Authors.

       " '\"\"\"Demand forecast accuracy in the service supply chains e.g. spare parts is critical for customer satisfaction and its financial performance. This is a typical logistic network which is affected by irregular demand resulting from contract and non-contract business strategies. Hence, existing forecasting methods that work excellent with smooth and linear demand patterns become less accurate with increasing erratic, lumpy and intermittent demands. Moreover, increasing number of stock keeping units (SKUs) in service supply chains have computational limitations. This is because of the fact that demand keep on fluctuating their demand classes that result in uncertainty and consequently, leads to higher target stock levels (TSL) and lower reorder point (ROP) to ensure higher customer satisfaction. This raises interest in using AI for service supply chains to improve demand forecast accuracy. In this paper, we present a survey of existing forecasting methods used in service and non-service supply chains to select best performing AI methods and performance measures, using ABC classification. Neural network (NN) and Mean Square Error (MSE), are subsequently modelled and used in aircraft spare parts supply chain using data collected from Dassault Aviation, as a function of most commonly used aggregated demand features. The results are compared with frequently and best performing forecast methods for intermittent demand as Croston, Croston SBJ and Croston TSB; and classical methods as moving average (MA) and single exponential smoothening (SES). The analysis and results suggest that NN with higher number of features improve demand forecast accuracy significantly for intermittent demands along with reduction in associated financial implications. © 2017\"\"\"',\n",

Network administrators and vendors are now moving beyond conventional Intrusion-Detection Systems (IDS), that only identify problems after they have occurred, to a novel, constructive approach termed Artificial Intelligence (AI) based intrusion detection system. Conventional network Intrusion Detection Systems and firewalls are usually preconfigured to spot malicious network attacks. Now-a-days attackers have become profounder and can try evading common detection rules. There are a few targeted areas where Artificial Intelligence will distribute the extreme evolution for Cybersecurity. To design a proactive defence mechanism, the system has to understand the intelligence of threats that are currently targeting the organization. The implementation of Machine Learning (ML) and threat intelligent-based solutions into blend can revolutionize the landscape in cyber security industry against any kinds of network attacks. Machine Learning is an application of AI that uses a system which is capable of learning from experience. Even in the era of extremely large amount of data and cybersecurity skill shortage, ML can aid in solving the most common tasks including regression, prediction, and classification. In this chapter, the origin and evolution of IDS has been described, followed by the classification of IDS. This chapter will provide a truly interactive learning experience to help and prepare the researchers for the challenges in traditional IDS and the contributions of ML in IDS. This comprehensive review briefs the prominent current works, and an outline of the datasets frequently used for evaluation purpose. Moreover, this chapter will also describe the Collaborative Intrusion Detection that enhances the Big Data Security. Finally, it presents the IDS research issues and challenges; and the skills that need to survive and thrive in today’s threat-ridden and target-rich cyber environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\"\"',\n",

Composing a service composition usually happens at design time, but this limit the choices of component services. This paper presents a framework for web service composition and execution based on the integration of different domains. Given a user\\'s query, and a list of service descriptions (in SAWSDL), the framework first provides an automated composition of services based on Fluent Calculus. This step, employing chaining inference from AI-planning with FLUX constraint programming method, generates a plan which is either a sequence or a parallel composition of operations offered by the selected services. As a second step, the plan is transformed into a BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) model in order to be executed by any BPMN engine.

       " '\"\"\"Randomly-connected networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons are known to display asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which resemble the discharge activity recorded in the cerebral cortex of awake animals. However, it is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models, or if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex intrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we investigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons, such as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This model can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS), regular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the oscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks using such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with surprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show that the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust emergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we investigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks with strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is reduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical networks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but with strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state transitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by two-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic properties such as adaptation and low-threshold bursting activity are crucial for the genesis and control of AI states in thalamocortical networks. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.\"\"\"',\n",

Enedis is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to choose which parts of the network have to be renewed. The general approach of the targeting method presented in this paper was initially developed for underground Low Voltage (LV) networks and has been successfully used for three years. However, it could not be directly applied to the Medium Voltage (MV) network due to its different structure, with fewer but much longer feeders. MV network reliability is even more critical since faults on this network usually have a bigger impact on power supply. In order to fit some machine learning models on a portion of the network which has a size relevant for renewal investment, it has been necessary to develop complex data analytics, such as graph calculation, to get the useful features to train the models. The technologies used for data preparation allows the solution to be scaled up after successful tests on smaller dataset. We estimate that this new method applied over a three years period increases the number of faulty cables identified by 60%, compared to the current business as usual targeting method. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

       " '\"\"\"It has been recognized that artificial intelligence (AI) will play an important role in future societies. AI has already been incorporated in many industries to improve business processes and automation. Although the aviation industry has successfully implemented flight management systems or autopilot to automate flight operations, it is expected that full embracement of AI remains a challenge. Given the rigorous validation process and the requirements for the highest level of safety standards and risk management, AI needs to prove itself being safe to operate. This paper addresses the safety issues of AI deployment in an aviation network compatible with the Future Communication Infrastructure that utilizes heterogeneous wireless access technologies for communications between the aircraft and the ground networks. It further considers the exploitation of software defined networking (SDN) technologies in the ground network while the adoption of SDN in the airborne network can be optional. Due to the nature of centralized management in SDN-based network, the SDN controller can become a single point of failure or a target for cyber attacks. To countermeasure such attacks, an intrusion detection system utilises AI techniques, more specifically deep neural network (DNN), is considered. However, an adversary can target the AI-based intrusion detection system. This paper examines the impact of AI security attacks on the performance of the DNN algorithm. Poisoning attacks targeting the DSL-KDD datasets which were used to train the DNN algorithm were launched at the intrusion detection system. Results showed that the performance of the DNN algorithm has been significantly degraded in terms of the mean square error, accuracy rate, precision rate and the recall rate. © 2020 IEEE.\"\"\"',\n",

An important side effect of these drugs is vaginal dryness for which local hormonal therapy (LHT) represents the most effective treatment but is theoretically contraindicated. This study aimed to assess whether the use of LHT increases the risk of breast cancer recurrence among women receiving endocrine treatment. We conducted a cohort study with nested case-control analysis using the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The cohort included female patients at least 18 years of age, newly diagnosed with breast cancer who received at least one AI or tamoxifen prescription between January 1, 1998 and June 30, 2008. Cases, who were patients experiencing a breast cancer recurrence during follow-up, were each matched with up to 10 controls based on age, date of cohort entry, type of endocrine treatment received, and duration of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate rate ratios (RR), and 95 % confidence intervals. A total of 13,479 women were included in the study, of which 2,673 received AIs, 10,806 received tamoxifen, and 271 received LHT. Mean (SD) age at cohort entry was 63.7 (14.1) years, and mean follow-up was 3.5 (2.6) years. The crude recurrence rate 25.9 per 1,000 per year. Overall, the use of LHT was not associated with an increased risk of recurrence (RR: 0.78, 95 % CI 0.48-1.25) compared with non-use. In stratified analyses, LHT did not increase the risk of recurrence among tamoxifen-treated patients (RR: 0.83, 95 % CI 0.51-1.34), while the risk was not estimable among AI-treated patients since no patients receiving LHT experienced a recurrence.

Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI\\'s association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals.

The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the \\'softwarization\\' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process. © 1963-2012 IEEE.\"\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\"\"Explainable AI (XAI) is gaining the momentum, at now. While the idea is to apply it in different scenarios, including medicine, business analytics, genomics computing and so forth, in this paper we focus the attention on another emerging case, represented by so called smart agricolture. In this paper, we propose the application of some well-known XAI tools on top of the Crop Recommendation dataset. Our research efforts also involve the sensitivity analysis of retrieved results.  © 2022 IEEE.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Research on database and information technologies has been rapidly evolving over the last couple of years. This evolution was lead by three major forces: Big Data, AI and Connected World that open the door to innovative research directions and challenges, yet exploiting four main areas: (i) computational and storage resource modeling and organization; (ii) new programming models, (iii) processing power and (iv) new applications that emerge related to health, environment, education, Cultural Heritage, Banking, etc. The 24th East-European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems (ADBIS 2020), the 24th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2020) and the 16th Workshop on Business Intelligence and Big Data (EDA 2020), held during August 25–27, 2020, at Lyon, France, and associated satellite events aimed at covering some emerging issues related to database and information system research in these areas. The aim of this paper is to present such events, their motivations, and topics of interest, as well as briefly outline the papers selected for presentations. The selected papers will then be included in the remainder of this volume. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"This article aims to present the approach of capitalization by ontologies proposed for the Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP). This approach is part of a global project of implementing a strategic intelligence device based on four pillars, namely: strategic watch, Knowledge Management, influence and lobbying techniques and protection and information security. The materialization of this project has gone through the realization of a study aiming three main objectives: (1) studying the monitoring practices within the OCP Group; (2) identifying and studying the needs of decision makers concerning strategic information; (3) propose a capitalization approach for information\\'s resulting from the strategic watch activities of the group in order to better position it in an increasingly competitive market. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a survey with the managers of the monitoring activities within the Group to better understand this activity and identify their needs and target our proposal. This project is the first national experiment in Morocco to develop ontology in the field of phosphates that can inspire other works in other sectors of activity. In this article, we will first present the context of the research. Then, we will dedicate a part of it for defining the main concepts mobilized in our research namely, strategic intelligence and ontologies. Finally, the process of designing and implementing the ontology. Although related since its appearance in the field of philosoph (Univesalis encyclopedia), the notion of ontology is considered in this article from an Artificial Intelligence (AI) angle. © 2018 IEEE.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"This article deals with the links between the enaction paradigm and artificial intelligence. Enaction is considered a metaphor for artificial intelligence, as a number of the notions which it deals with are deemed incompatible with the phenomenal field of the virtual. After explaining this stance, we shall review previous works regarding this issue in terms of artificial life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of co-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly integrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine the ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction paradigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated can therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from the environment. This proposition does not however, resolve that of the relevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such reflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in order to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial intelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an enactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues, thereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of morphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of minimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the problem of artificial intelligence in a variety of enaction-based ways. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"My claim in this article is that the 1950 paper in which Turing describes the world-famous set-up of the Imitation Game is much richer and intriguing than the formalist ersatz coined in the early 1970s under the name Turing Test. Therefore, doing justice to the Imitation Game implies showing first, that the formalist interpretation misses some crucial points in Turing\\'s line of thought and second, that the 1950 paper should not be understood as the Magna Chartaof strong Artificial Intelligence (AI) but as a work in progressfocused on the notion of Form. This has unexpected consequences about the status of Mind, and from a more general point of view, about the way we interpret the notions of Science and Language. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Combining aquaculture and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies still poses several challenges. IoT technologies are exploited to enhance productivity in aquaculture sites by maintaining precise operating conditions and to avoid undesirable situations. Currently, human intervention is still needed to make good decisions, dependant on the values of parameters detected by sensors, often captured at one point in time in a day. This is not only a time-consuming task but also an inaccurate one since parameters, such as water quality, evolves continuously and affects the whole aquaculture system. This is mainly caused by the lack of information collection, exchange and process automation between different actors in aquaculture farms. To overcome these problems, technologies such as semantic Web technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI), are bringing new capabilities to organise data in an inter-operable way to then be processed and used for monitoring and decision-making. In this context, we are proposing in this paper a fully semantic based-reference data model for Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) that involves the collection, processing, and sharing of data both between components and between the platform and external aqua-systems by supporting IoT and data information standards. It is based on analysis of the current data models and covers the core concepts required for aquaculture management and has been validated against several business scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Workload-driven approaches for partitioning and tuning traditional Parallel Database systems are well studied in the literature. Unfortunately, in the context of new generation \"Big Data\"warehouses, these approaches are not correctly adapted to Business Intelligence 2.0, where the analyst is at the heart of decision support systems. This \"disconnect\"situation strongly impacts both data partitioning and fragment allocation processes, which are essential to achieve good query performance. To overcome this problem, recent studies proposed online data partitioning and fragment allocation using AI techniques to improve query performance with adaptive behavior. Nevertheless, they have important limitations: they add significant overhead and they tend to focus on the current workload, ignoring query logs. With such motivation in mind, we first formulate the problem of optimizing database partitioning subject to feasibility constraints, based on a query workload. We then introduce a proactive partitioning approach combining offline and online processing phases, inspired by closed-loop control (used in engineering disciplines) and genetic algorithms (from AI). We present an experimental validation on a big data cluster that shows promising results on typical OLAP workloads. © 2020 IEEE.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Purpose: The main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of AI-based transformation projects. This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) due to H5N1 virus was first reported in Egypt in February 2006; since then, the government has allowed avian influenza vaccination in poultry. The present study evaluated the impact of AI vaccination in terms of cumulative annual flock immunity (CAFI): the percentage of bird × weeks protected by immunity. This evaluation took account of the combined effects of vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacy (VE), and different characteristics of household poultry production on the effectiveness of the adopted vaccination strategy (VS), and provided alternative options for improvement. The evaluation used a population and vaccinationmodel that calculates the CAFI. Participatory approaches were employed in 21 villages to develop the vaccination and flock parameters required for the model. The adopted VS were compared in the model with three alternative VS scenarios in terms of the CAFI. Vaccination coverage varied among villages but was generally low (between 1 and 48 %; median 14 %). Under the adopted VS, the CAFI predicted for the villages ranged from 2 to 31 %. It was concluded that despite the enormous effort put into rural household poultry AI vaccination by the Egyptian government, village CAFI is unlikely to be maintained at the levels required to significantly reduce the virus load and restrict transmission. In HPAI-endemic countries that consider AI vaccination as one of the disease control options, the high cost of mass AI vaccination campaigns and their achievable benefits must be compared with other available control measures, which may include targeted vaccination. Achievable vaccination coverage, VE and the different characteristics of commercial and household (village) poultry production are key parameters determining the feasibility and costeffectiveness of different AI vaccination strategies. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.\"\"\"']"
