New data streams (""big data"") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of ""new""modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: Technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-And-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine ""old""and ""new""modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained. In this review, we share our view on the current and future limitations of modeling and potential next steps for modelers in the animal sciences. First, we discuss the inherent dependencies and limitations of modeling as a human process. Then, we highlight how models, fueled by AI, can play an enhanced sustainable role in the animal sciences ecosystem. Lastly, we provide recommendations for future animal scientists on how to support themselves, the farmers, and their field, considering the opportunities and challenges the technological innovation brings.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Large companies can take advantage of a deluge of data, typically withhold from the research community due to privacy or business sensitivity concerns, and this is particularly true for networking data. Therefore, the lack of high quality data is often recognized as one of the main factors currently limiting networking research from fully leveraging AI methodologies potential. Following numerous requests we received from the scientific community, we release AppClassNet, a commercial-grade dataset for benchmarking traffic classification and management methodologies. AppClassNet is significantly larger than the datasets generally available to the academic community in terms of both the number of samples and classes, and reaches scales similar to the popular ImageNet dataset commonly used in computer vision literature. To avoid leaking user- and business-sensitive information, we opportunely anonymized the dataset, while empirically showing that it still represents a relevant benchmark for algorithmic research. In this paper, we describe the public dataset and our anonymization process. We hope that AppClassNet can be instrumental for other researchers to address more complex commercial-grade problems in the broad field of traffic classification and management.

A significant database obtained from test flights using aircraft instrumented with strain gauges has been provided as part of an Artificial Intelligence challenge organized by the French Ile-de-France region and the aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. Learning techniques are considered to train a prediction model of the aircraft structural stress. The proposed baseline includes a clustering step for phase identification in time series and an ensemble model with two stacked regressors. The model is trained on a dataset of 117 flights and its overall performance is evaluated on a validation set of flight sequences from 186 flights. The main advantages of the proposed learning approach are its prediction accuracy, its training frugality and its interpretability. This paper presents a global data science workflow applied to a problem of structural stress prediction. Despite a development in a constrained time period with no direct access to the data, the proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of the concept of learned virtual sensor of aircraft structural stress and paves the way for applications to other structures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Aircraft Digital Twin;

This is because of its potential to cause drastic and widespread shifts in many aspects of life that are comparable to those of the Internet and smartphones. More specifically, generative AI utilizes machine learning, neural networks, and other techniques to generate new content (e.g. text, images, music) by analyzing patterns and information from the training data. This has enabled generative AI to have a wide range of applications, from creating personalized content to improving business operations. Despite its many benefits, there are also significant concerns about the negative implications of generative AI. In view of this, the current article brings together experts in a variety of fields to expound and provide multi-disciplinary insights on the opportunities, challenges, and research agendas of generative AI in specific industries (i.e. marketing, healthcare, human resource, education, banking, retailing, the workplace, manufacturing, and sustainable IT management). © 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems.","Bard; ChatGPT; Generative artificial intelligence; large language model; machine learning","Human resource management; Industrial research; Music; Bard; ChatGPT; Generative artificial intelligence; Language model; Large language model; Learning neural networks; Machine-learning; Organizational levels; Smart phones; Text images; Machine learning","","","","","","","Hu K., ChatGPT sets record for fastest-growing user base - analyst note, (2023); Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7%, (2023); Zao-Sanders M., Ramos M., A framework for picking the right generative AI project, (2023); Mauran C., Bing chatbot now lets you fine-tune its personality, (2023); The new Bing and edge - increasing limits on chat sessions, (2023); Wei J., Wang X., Schuurmans D., Bosma M., Xia F., Chi E., Le Q.V., Zhou D., Chain-of-thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language models, Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, 35, pp. 24824-24837, (2022); Lancaster A., Beyond chatbots: the rise of large language models, (2023); Dwivedi Y.K., Pandey N., Currie W., Micu A., Leveraging ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications in the hospitality and tourism industry: practices, challenges and research agenda, Int J Contemp Hosp Manag, (2023); Dwivedi Y.K., Kshetri N., Hughes L., Slade E.L., Jeyaraj A., Kar A.K., Baabdullah A.M., Koohang A., Raghavan V., Ahuja M., Et al., “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy, Int J Inf Manag, 71, (2023); GPT-4 technical report, (2023); Edwards B., GPT-4 will hunt for trends in medical records thanks to Microsoft and epic, (2023); Levy A., 2 companies are using generative AI to supercharge revenue, (2023); Yusuf K., Introducing WatsonX: The future of AI for business, (2023); Generative AI, (2023); Piktus A., Online tools help large language models to solve problems through reasoning, Nature, 618, 7965, pp. 465-466, (2023); Manyika J., Sneader K., AI, automation, and the future of work: Ten things to solve for, (2018); Hatzius J., Briggs J., Kodnani D., Pierdomenico G., The potentially large effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth, (2023); Mukherjee S., Foo Y.C., Coulter M., EU proposes new copyright rules for generative AI, (2023); Sinha P., Shastri A., Lorimer S.E., How generative AI will change sales, (2023); Dwivedi Y.K., Hughes L., Baabdullah A.M., Ribeiro-Navarrete S., Giannakis M., Al-Debei M.M., Dennehy D., Metri B., Buhalis D., Cheung C.M., Et al., Metaverse beyond the hype: multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy, Int J Inf Manag, 66, (2022); Dwivedi Y.K., Hughes L., Wang Y., Alalwan A.A., Ahn S.J., Balakrishnan J., Barta S., Belk R., Buhalis D., Dutot V., Et al., Metaverse marketing: how the metaverse will shape the future of consumer research and practice, Psychol Mark, 40, 4, pp. 750-776, (2023); DragGAN: the AI-powered image editing tool that makes editing images easy, (2023); Reddington C., How companies are boosting productivity with generative AI, (2023); Schwartz E.H., Duolingo and OpenAI will build generative AI chatbots to teach languages, (2023); Mehdi Y., Reinventing search with a new AI-powered Microsoft Bing and edge, your copilot for the web, (2023); Microsoft integrates AI behind ChatGPT to more developer tools, (2023); Pichai S., An important next step on our AI journey, (2023); Toribio A., Google incorporates generative AI into its search engine, (2023); Salesforce announces Einstein GPT, the world’s first generative AI for CRM, (2023); McGee-Smith S., How salesforce’s Einstein GPT works, (2023); Pandey N., Tripathi A., Jain D., Roy S., Does price tolerance depend upon the type of product in e-retailing?

An emerging stream of modern analytics methods have focused on analyzing software development firms and their approach to coding and software development, with a view to optimize key processes through data to enhance organizational value. Despite systematic developments within the field, many high throughput software suffers from incomprehensible bad program structure that results in imbalanced performance throughout its lifecycle. This phenomenon is widely known as “Code Smells, i.e., design flaws”. A series of AI and ML based algorithms and mathematical tools were developed to tackle the problem in the past. However, at the business and decision-making level there are large uncertainties on how to optimize resource allocation towards each code smell class to maximize benefit of the process. In this paper we propose a novel mathematical business model that will help business and operational managers to optimize budget and resource allocation towards detection of maximum number of smells within a system, with increased output efficiency. Our proposed model benefits from a real life validation of code smell dataset, along with detailed prescription of optimal resource allocation along with reasoning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Optimization models; Resource allocation decision model; Software code smells; Software reliability","","","","","","","","Al Dallal J., Identifying refactoring opportunities in object-oriented code: A systematic literature review, Information and Software Technology, 58, pp. 231-249, (2015); Almeida D., Campos J.C., Saraiva J., Silva J.C., Towards a catalog of usability smells, SAC ’15: Proceedings of the 30Th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 175-181, (2015); Anand A., Gupta P., Klochkov Y., Yadavalli V.S.S., Modeling software fault removal and vulnerability detection and related patch release policy, System Reliability Management, pp. 19-34, (2018); Anand A., Das S., Singh O., Kumar V., Resource allocation problem for multi versions of software system, In 2019 Amity International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AICAI, pp. 571-576, (2019); Software multi up-gradation modeling based on different scenarios, In Advances in Reliability Analysis and Its Applications (Pp., pp. 293-305, (2020); Anand A., Kaur J., Gokhale A.A., Ram M., Impact of available resources on software patch management, Systems Performance Modeling, Walter De Gruyter Gmbh & Co KG, 4, pp. 1-11, (2020); Anand A., Kaur J., Singh O., Ram M., Optimal resource allocation for software development under Agile framework, Reliability: Theory & Applications, (SI, 2, 64, pp. 48-58, (2021); Arnaoudova V., Di Penta M., Antoniol G., GuEhEneuc Y.-G., A new family of software anti-patterns: Linguistic antipatterns, CSMR ’13: Proceedings of the 2013 17Th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering, pp. 187-196, (2013); Ashrafi A., Ravasan A.Z., Trkman P., Afshari S., The role of business analytics capabilities in bolstering firms’ agility and performance, International Journal of Information Management, 47, pp. 1-15, (2019); Azeem M.I., Palomba F., Shi L., Wang Q., Machine learning techniques for code smell detection: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis, Information and Software Technology, 108, pp. 115-138, (2019); Bavota G., Qusef A., Oliveto R., de Lucia A., Binkley D., An empirical analysis of the distribution of unit test smells and their impact on software maintenance, In IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance, ICSM.

In a so-called Industry 4.0. era, understanding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in developed as well as in underdeveloped economies has become increasingly crucial. The purpose of this study is to shed the light on the peculiarities of Chinese AI assessing the state of art of AI in this unique and valuable context. Design/methodology/approach: Through a research based on a qualitative data analysis, the present paper suggests a new way to analyse AI and to support a better understanding of the local Chinese aspects influencing its development and implementation. Findings: The development and implementation of AI in China required tailor solutions which account for the following three main dimensions: the location (i.e. territorial extension, the administrative boundaries); the government approach; and the human capital. Originality/value: The analysis presents a broad level activity. In addition, the paper focused on Chinese scientific literature and different types of data (i.e. institutional documents, professional reports, websites and speeches in Chinese). The paper used a multi-faceted approach, including also the tacit knowledge of the authors about the context under investigation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; China; Cutting-edge technologies; Industry 4.0; Society’s change","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71704069)","This study was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China Project (No. 71704069).","Bryman A., Bell E., Business Research Methods, (2011); Bryman A., Burgess B., Analyzing Qualitative Data, (2002); Cao J., Zhou Y.L., Research progress on the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy, Economic Perspectives, 1, pp. 103-115, (2018); A deep dive into 25 global metro areas and their top tech companies, (2018); Chan K.W., Misconceptions and complexities in the study of china's cities: definitions,statistics, and implications, Eurasian Geography and Economics, (2007); Chen P., Iflytek: let the world listen to the voice of China, China Business, 21, pp. 86-91, (2018); Chen J., Zhang Y.J., Wang J., A comparative study on the development of AI industry between China and U.

Against that background, the paper reviews the recent service robot literature following a Theory-Context-Characteristics-Methodology (TCCM) approach to capture the state of art of the field. In addition, building on qualitative input from researchers who are active in this field, the authors highlight where opportunities for further development and growth lie. Design/methodology/approach: The paper identifies and analyzes 88 manuscripts (featuring 173 individual studies) published in academic journals featured on the SERVSIG literature alert. In addition, qualitative input gathered from 79 researchers who are active in the service field and doing research on service robots is infused throughout the manuscript. Findings: The key research foci of the service robot literature to date include comparing service robots with humans, the role of service robots' look and feel, consumer attitudes toward service robots and the role of service robot conversational skills and behaviors. From a TCCM view, the authors discern dominant theories (anthropomorphism theory), contexts (retail/healthcare, USA samples, Business-to-Consumer (B2C) settings and customer focused), study characteristics (robot types: chatbots, not embodied and text/voice-based; outcome focus: customer intentions) and methodologies (experimental, picture-based scenarios). Originality/value: The current paper is the first to analyze the service robot literature from a TCCM perspective. Doing so, the study gives (1) a comprehensive picture of the field to date and (2) highlights key pathways to inspire future work. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI; Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Conversational agent; Robotics; Service encounter; Service robots","","","","","","","","Amelia A., Mathies C., Patterson P.G., Customer acceptance of frontline service robots in retail banking: a qualitative approach, Journal of Service Management; Arnould E.J., Thompson C.J., Consumer culture theory (CCT): twenty years of research, Journal of Consumer Research, 31, 4, pp. 868-882, (2005); Bakker A.B., Demerouti E., The job demands-resources model: state of the art, Journal of Managerial Psychology, 22, 3, pp. 309-328, (2007); Balakrishnan J., Dwivedi Y.K., Role of cognitive absorption in building user trust and experience, Psychology and Marketing, 38, 4, pp. 643-668, (2021); Banks J., Theory of mind in social robots: replication of five established human tests, International Journal of Social Robotics, 12, 2, pp. 403-414, (2020); Belanche D., Casalo L.V., Flavian C., Schepers J., Robots or frontline employees?

Hence, this study is aimed at achieving timely, anticipated and effective response throughout the cycle of a disaster, extreme weather and emergency operations management with the help of advanced technologies. This study proposes a novel, evidence-based framework (4-AIDE) that highlights the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based collaborative platforms in disaster, extreme weather and emergency situations. A qualitative approach underpinned by organizational information processing theory (OIPT) is employed to design, develop and conduct semi-structured interviews with 33 respondents having experience in AI and cloud computing industries during emergency and extreme weather situations. For analysing the collected data, axial, open and selective coding is used that further develop themes, propositions and an evidence-based framework. The study findings indicate that AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms offer a structured and logical approach to enable two-way, algorithm-based communication to collect, analyse and design effective management strategies for disaster and extreme weather situations. Managers of public systems or businesses can collect and analyse data to predict possible outcomes and take necessary actions in an extreme weather situation. Communities and societies can be more resilient by transmitting and receiving data to AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms. These actions can also help policymakers identify critical pockets and guide administration for their necessary preparation for unexpected, extreme weather, and emergency events. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Cloud technologies; Disaster management; Extreme weather; Organizational information processing theory","Computation theory; Disaster prevention; Emergency services; Cloud based collaborative; Cloud technologies; Collaborative platform; Disaster management; Emergency operations; Extreme weather; Information processing theories; Organizational information processing; Organizational information processing theory; Weather operations; Artificial intelligence","","","","","NEOMA Business School, France, (416005)","This study has been supported by the Area of Excellence AI, Data Science & Business at NEOMA Business School, France under the fund number 416005 .","Ahmad M.I., Ma H., An investigation of the targeting and allocation of post-flood disaster aid for rehabilitation in Punjab, Pakistan, Int.

It contains 6.7k annotated business documents, 100k synthetically generated documents, and nearly 1M unlabeled documents for unsupervised pre-training. The dataset has been built with knowledge of domain- and task-specific aspects, resulting in the following key features: (i) annotations in 55 classes, which surpasses the granularity of previously published key information extraction datasets by a large margin; (ii) Line Item Recognition represents a highly practical information extraction task, where key information has to be assigned to items in a table; (iii) documents come from numerous layouts and the test set includes zero- and few-shot cases as well as layouts commonly seen in the training set. The benchmark comes with several baselines, including RoBERTa, LayoutLMv3 and DETR-based Table Transformer; applied to both tasks of the DocILE benchmark, with results shared in this paper, offering a quick starting point for future work.

The AHMM is based on cross-functional research on an authentic and proprietary mixed research method that is supported by his own version of an AI search tree, which is combined with an internal heuristic's algorithm. The main focus is on CTCCS requirements and transformation strategy. The proposed AHMM4CTC based CTC-CS is a virtual secured computing environment which uses an integrated empiric decision-making process. The CTC-CS is supported by a real-life case of business transformation project, which needs a Cloud infrastructure that is supported by the alignment of various existing Cloud standards. © 2023, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Agievich V., Mathematical model and multi-criteria analysis of designing large-scale enterprise roadmap, (2014); Bala R., Gill B., Smith D., Wright D., Ji K., Magic Quadrantfor Cloud Infrastructureand Platform Services, (2021); Hosting and Cloud Software Delivery modelled in Archimate, (2017); Private Cloud, (2022); Daellenbach H., McNickle D., Management Science.

It presents a proposed typology and new directions for academia-industry collaborations in the field of AI and creativity in marketing as well as examined the potential for AI-enabled support for creative thinking about business models. By carefully addressing the challenges, organizations can effectively leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence and emerging new technologies to foster business creativity in a responsible and ethical way with due regard for its potential impact on society and the workforce. Overall, the key to leveraging the power of AI for business creativity is to understand how it can augment and enhance our human capabilities rather than replace them.

It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well-being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research. © 2023 The Authors.

ChatGPT has been fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning technology. Various types of organizations are interested in adopting applications supported by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 platforms, but there is an acute shortage of trained workers in this field. Research is needed to investigate the role of this very new technology and skilled workers in maintaining business sustainability. Also, few studies have investigated the role of leadership motivation in accelerating business sustainability. Therefore, this study aims to examine the role of ChatGPT and skilled employees in business sustainability. It also investigates the moderating impact of leadership motivation on business sustainability. With the help of resource-based view (RBV) and the extant literature, a theoretical model was developed, which was then validated using the PLS-SEM technique on feedback from 209 respondents. The study finds that both ChatGPT and skilled workers have significant impact on improving business sustainability. The study also demonstrates that leadership motivation significantly impacts business sustainability. © 2023 by the authors.","ChatGPT; disruptive innovation; leadership motive; PLS-SEM; RBV; sustainability","artificial intelligence; business; innovation; skilled labor; supervised learning; sustainability; technology adoption; theoretical study","","","","","","","Chen L., Chen X., Wu S., Yang Y., Chang M., Zhu H., The future of ChatGPT-enabled labor market: A preliminary study, arXiv, (2023); Lokman A.S., Ameedeen M.A., Modern Chatbot Systems: A Technical Review, Proceedings of the Future Technologies Conference, pp. 1012-1023; Melis G., Dyer C., Blunsom P., On the state of the art of evaluation in neural language models, arXiv, (2017); Radford A., Narasimhan K., Salimans T., Sutskever I., Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.

This saliency is no less important for firms operating in the agricultural technology (AgriTech) sector, where the impacts of AI-driven technologies and systems create new opportunities and challenges. We argue that with the unique characteristics of AI technologies and emerging challenges and aspirations of the AgriTech sector, there is a need to rethink traditional theories of technology adoption and readiness within AgriTech firms. In this paper, we develop an understanding of AI readiness and adoption through a fuller appreciation of micro- and meso-empirical data that delineates the determinants of AI readiness and uncovers a set of strategic components that can help AgriTech firms better manage the readiness process for AI adoption. To do this, we employ a mixed-methods approach and elicit data from 236 e-surveys and 25 interviews from an important conference in the AgriTech field. Our findings have implications for research and practice to understand AI technological readiness. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Agricultural technology; Artificial intelligence; Mixed- methods; Readiness and adoption","Agricultural technology; Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Adoption framework; Agricultural technologies; Business problems; Machine computations; Mixed method; Power; Readiness and adoption; Self-learning capability; Technological advancement; Technology sectors; agricultural technology; algorithm; artificial intelligence; technology adoption; Computation theory","","","","","","","Aborg C., Billing A., Health effects of “the paperless office”−evaluations of the introduction of electronic document handling systems, Behav.

However, there is paucity of research insights on the factors influencing AI-human partnership and its impact on business performance. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper draws on the knowledge-based view, (KBV) socio-technical systems (STS) and organisational socialisation framework (OSF) to develop and validate a novel theoretical model examining the relationships between knowledge sharing, employees’ AI skills, trust, and role clarity in a collaborative working environment to enhance business performance. A primary survey-based research method was used to capture responses from 164 employees in the UK creative industries, and further analysed by employing Structural Equation Modelling technique. Our findings will provide managers and the AI community with primary evidence and strategies that will help to develop collaborative intelligence capabilities within the organisations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Business performance; Human collaboration; Knowledge-based view; Organisational socialisation framework; Socio-technical systems","","","","","","Grand Challenge Research Funds; Royal Academy of Engineering, UK Research and Innovation; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG; Royal Society; British Council; Research Councils UK, RCUK; Aston University; Horizon 2020; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: Professor Prasanta Kumar Dey is Professor of Operations Management at Aston Business School.

For each of the largest banks operating in France we build by an algorithm pseudo-internal models of credit risk management for a range of methodologies extensively used in AI (random forest, gradient boosting, ridge regression, neural network). We compare these models to the traditional model usually in place that basically relies on a combination of logistic regression and expert judgement. The comparison is made along two sets of criterias capturing: the ability to pass compliance tests used by the regulators during on-site missions of model validation (i), and the induced changes in capital requirement (ii). The different models show noticeable differences in their ability to pass the regulatory tests and to lead to a reduction in capital requirement. While displaying a similar ability than the traditional model to pass compliance tests, neural networks provide the strongest incentive for banks to apply AI models for their internal model of credit risk of corporate businesses as they lead in some cases to sizeable reduction in capital requirement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Credit risk; Regulatory requirement","","","","","","","","(2020); Albanessi S., Vamossy D.F., (2019); Khandani A.E., Kim A.J., Lo A.W., Consumer credit-risk models via machine-learning algorithms, J.

This transformation is based on the use of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and information and communication technologies (ICT), in particular artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This new paradigm has brought changes in various areas of the functioning of the organization through a DT that holistically affects business processes, products, relationships and competencies which is a major challenge for organizations. This paper is dedicated to analyze the literature on BPM in the digital industry era through a bibliometric analysis, in order to analyze the impact of the I4.0 concepts and their associated technologies on the BPM, which will allow to determine the main BPM issues.

These businesses built the networks that enable the global transfer of text, audio, speech, and video. Companies in the telecommunications industry include those that provide landline and cellular telephone service, as well as those that provide cable television, satellite television, and online access. Once upon a time, the telecommunications industry was dominated by a small group of extremely large multinational and regional conglomerates. The industry has been caught up in a wave of liberalization and innovation since the early 2000s. Government monopolies have been privatized in several nations, exposing them to an explosion of new rivals. As mobile services continue to grow at a faster rate than fixed-line ones, and as Internet traffic begins to surpass voice traffic as the dominant form of commerce, established marketplaces have been turned on their heads. The undertaken paper endeavors to highlight the vulnerabilities that the telecommunication networking sector could be facing in the present as well as the future in light of the usage of artificial intelligence as assistive and advanced tech. © 2023 by author(s).","AI; cloud; industry; network; NGN; telecommunication","","","","","","","","Jiang Y, Gu J., Technological transformation, Technology and Industrial Transformation of China, pp. 1-19, (2022); Hoolihan DD., A review of developments in wireless and electrical engineering, IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Magazine, 12, 1, pp. 29-30, (2022); Khan N, Ray RL, Zhang S, Et al., Influence of mobile phone and internet technology on income of rural farmers: Evidence from khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan, Technology in Society, 68, (2022); Maryam Husniati AM, Fahira L, Suwiji Y., Implementation of policies for devoleping aceh’s micro, small and medium enterprises, Proceedings of International Conference on Social Science, Political Science, and Humanities (ICoSPOLHUM), (2022); Bourekkadi S, El Imrani O, Kandili M, Et al., Intelligent solution based on information technologies—The correct value of the business in economic organization is intangible asset, pp. 6310-6317, (2019); Antioco M, Coussement K, Fletcher-Chen CCY, Prange C., What’s in a word?

However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the role of intangible organisational capabilities to drive AI adoption within SMEs that will lead to SC productivity, low carbon management, and resilience. To bridge this gap in the literature, our research employs perceived organisational support (POS) as the theoretical lens to develop a theoretical model that is tested by surveying 375 Vietnamese managers of manufacturing SMEs. Our findings from structural equation modelling analysis demonstrate that organisational change capacity will facilitate AI adoption, which will lead to SC productivity, resilience, and low carbon management because of SMEs’ ability to leverage AI for data-driven decision making. Based on POS theory, our research highlights the role of intangible SME resources in implementing sustainable digital SCs’ transformation, an essential strategy for acting as IIs in business ecosystems. Our findings will help SMEs to develop strategies that will enhance skills, competencies, expertise, and organisational creativity conducive to the needs of the human workforce. This will enhance the capacity and capability of SMEs to innovate, manage, and efficiently adapt to change in a technologically turbulent, dynamic, uncertain, and volatile business environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Digital transformation; Innovation intermediaries; Low carbon management; Organisational capabilities; Résilience; Sustainability","","","","","","Circular Economy Knowledge Hub; British Council, (—528201836)","Funding text 1: Author 1 declares no conflicts of interest.

However, recent studies have found that organisations are yet to experience the anticipated benefits from AI adoption, despite investing time, effort, and resources. The existing studies in HRM have examined the applications of AI, anticipated benefits, and its impact on human workforce and organisations. The aim of this paper is to systematically review the multi-disciplinary literature stemming from International Business, Information Management, Operations Management, General Management and HRM to provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of the organisational resources required to develop AI capability in HRM. Our findings show that organisations need to look beyond technical resources, and put their emphasis on developing non-technical ones such as human skills and competencies, leadership, team co-ordination, organisational culture and innovation mindset, governance strategy, and AI-employee integration strategies, to benefit from AI adoption. Based on these findings, we contribute five research propositions to advance AI scholarship in HRM. Theoretically, we identify the organisational resources necessary to achieve business benefits by proposing the AI capability framework, integrating resource-based view and knowledge-based view theories. From a practitioner's standpoint, our framework offers a systematic way for the managers to objectively self-assess organisational readiness and develop strategies to adopt and implement AI-enabled practices and processes in HRM. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","AI capability; AI-employee collaboration; Artificial intelligence; Human resource management; Organisational resources; Systematic review","","","","","","Aston University, (2020-21)","The research reported in this manuscript is funded by College of Busines and Social and Social Science (Aston University) Seed Grants 2020-21 for the project, ‘Developing Artificial Intelligence Capacity, Capability and Strategy’.","Ahmed O., Artificial intelligence in HR, International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews, 5, 4, pp. 971-978, (2018); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Orgnizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Alsheibani S.A., Cheung D., Messom D., Factors inhibiting the adoption of artificial intelligence at organizational-level: A preliminary investigation, (2019); Amabile T.M., Creativity, artificial intelligence, and a world of surprises, Academy of Management Discoveries, 6, 3, pp. 351-354, (2020); Ananny M., Toward an ethics of algorithms: Convening, observation, probability, and timeliness, Science, Technology, & Human Values, 41, 1, pp. 93-117, (2016); Angrave D., Charlwood A., Kirkpatrick I., Lawrence M., Stuart M., HR and analytics: Why HR is set to fail the big data challenge, Human Resource Management Journal, 26, 1, pp. 1-11, (2016); Araujo T., Helberger N., Kruikemeier S., De Vreese C.H., In AI we trust?

This study aimed to investigate whether current studies assessing AI contain the information required for health technology assessment (HTA) by HTA bodies. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology to extract articles published between 2016 and 2021 related to the assessment of AI-based MDs. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, technology, algorithms, comparators, and results. AI quality assessment and HTA scores were calculated to evaluate whether the items present in the included studies were concordant with the HTA requirements. We performed a linear regression for the HTA and AI scores with the explanatory variables of the impact factor, publication date, and medical specialty. We conducted a univariate analysis of the HTA score and a multivariate analysis of the AI score with an alpha risk of 5 %. Results: Of 5578 retrieved records, 56 were included. The mean AI quality assessment score was 67 %; 32 % of articles had an AI quality score ≥ 70 %, 50 % had a score between 50 % and 70 %, and 18 % had a score under 50 %. The highest quality scores were observed for the study design (82 %) and optimisation (69 %) categories, whereas the scores were lowest in the clinical practice category (23 %). The mean HTA score was 52 % for all seven domains. 100 % of the studies assessed clinical effectiveness, whereas only 9 % evaluated safety, and 20 % evaluated economic issues. There was a statistically significant relationship between the impact factor and the HTA and AI scores (both p = 0.046). Discussion: Clinical studies on AI-based MDs have limitations and often lack adapted, robust, and complete evidence. High-quality datasets are also required because the output data can only be trusted if the inputs are reliable. The existing assessment frameworks are not specifically designed to assess AI-based MDs. From the perspective of regulatory authorities, we suggest that these frameworks should be adapted to assess the interpretability, explainability, cybersecurity, and safety of ongoing updates. From the perspective of HTA agencies, we highlight that transparency, professional and patient acceptance, ethical issues, and organizational changes are required for the implementation of these devices. Economic assessments of AI should rely on a robust methodology (business impact or health economic models) to provide decision-makers with more reliable evidence. Conclusion: Currently, AI studies are insufficient to cover HTA prerequisites. HTA processes also need to be adapted because they do not consider the important specificities of AI-based MDs. Specific HTA workflows and accurate assessment tools should be designed to standardise evaluations, generate reliable evidence, and create confidence. © 2023 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence-based medical device; Clinical trial; Economic evaluation; Health technology assessment; Machine learning","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Technology Assessment, Biomedical; Data mining; Ethical technology; Machine learning; Multivariant analysis; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; 'current; Artificial intelligence-based medical device; Clinical study; Clinical trial; Economics evaluations; Health technology assessments; Machine-learning; Medical Devices; Quality assessment; Systematic Review; artificial intelligence; biomedical technology assessment; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; computer security; device safety; diagnosis; economic aspect; economic evaluation; human; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; screening; systematic review; algorithm; cost benefit analysis; health care delivery; procedures; Quality control","","","","","","","Mesko B., Gorog M., A short guide for medical professionals in the era of artificial intelligence, Npj Digit Med, 3, (2020); Alami H., Lehoux P., Auclair Y., de Guise M., Gagnon M.-P., Shaw J., Et al., Artificial intelligence and health technology assessment: anticipating a new level of complexity, J Med Internet Res, 22, (2020); Harvey H.B., Gowda V., How the FDA regulates AI, Acad Radiol, 27, pp. 58-61, (2020); Cruz Rivera S., Liu X., Chan A.-W., Denniston A.K., Calvert M.J., SPIRIT-AI, Et al., Guidelines for clinical trial protocols for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the SPIRIT-AI extension, Nat Med, 26, pp. 1351-1363, (2020); Liu X., Cruz Rivera S., Moher D., Calvert M.J., Denniston A.K., SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI Working Group.

Accurately extracting key-value pairs from such documents is crucial for downstream tasks like accounting, analytics, and decision-making. In this paper, we propose a method for grouping and linking key-value pairs in business documents using a combination of rule-based methods and pretrained transformers. Our method comprises three steps: grouping words into word groups using rule-based methods that rely on layout information obtained via OCR, classifying the groups of words into key, value, or other using a pretrained BERT multilingual model, and linking the predicted key-value pairs based on their relative positions in the document, leveraging the layout information. Furthermore, we present a comparative study of our approach against state-of-the-art methods for key-value extraction in business documents. Our approach is designed to be adaptable and requires minimal semantic and language-specific knowledge, making it suitable for a wide range of business documents. This flexibility allows our method to be easily applied to real-world scenarios, where documents may vary in layout and language. Additionally, our method is computationally efficient, allowing for fast processing of large volumes of documents. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining rule-based methods with pretrained transformers for key-value extraction in business documents, providing a strong foundation for developing more accurate and robust methods in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business documents; Key-value extraction; Pretrained transformers","Classification (of information); Decision making; Knowledge management; Semantics; Business documents; Decisions makings; Down-stream; Key values; Key-value extraction; Key-value pairs; Layout information; Pretrained transformer; Relative positions; Rule-based method; Extraction","","","","","YOOZ, (ANR-21-PRRD-0010-01)","Acknowledgment.

We first present a theoretical review of the concept of business creativity and the impact of AI on organizational creativity as a possible way to predict different dimensions of creative output. We conducted several exploratory interviews with managers and key leaders in the field, and we summarize the reflection by adopting the “three-dimensional concurrent engineering” framework (Fine et al., 2002), which adds value chain engineering to augment the traditional two-dimensional concurrent engineering of products and processes. Adopting this framework, we specifically investigate three main dimensions in which AI systems have to stimulate business creativity: (1) product/service design - stimulating continuous and ongoing innovation allowing new product/service design; (2) new optimized processes and procedures across teams; (3) assistance to organizations to be more creative by facilitating and increasing collaborations (sharing of resources) and alliances. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Margherita Pagani and Renaud Champion; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Andriopoulos C., Determinants of organisational creativity: A literature review, Management Decision, 39, 10, pp. 834-841, (2001); Amabile T.M., Creativity in context, (1996); Amabile T.M., Barsade S.G., Mueller J.S., Staw B.M., Affect and creativity at work, Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, 3, pp. 367-403, (2005); Amabile T., Pratt M.G., The dynamic componential model of creativity and innovation in organizations: Making progress, making meaning, Research in Organizational Behavior, 36, pp. 157-183, (2016); Burroughs J.E., Mick D.G., Exploring antecedents and consequences of consumer creativity in a problem-solving context, Journal of Consumer Research, 31, 2, pp. 402-411, (2004); Burroughs J.E., Moreau C.P., Mick D.G., Toward a psychology of consumer creativity, Handbook of consumer psychology, pp. 1011-1038, (2008); Dahl D.W., Moreau C.P., Thinking inside the box: Why consumers enjoy constrained creative experiences, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 3, pp. 357-369, (2007); Elsbach K., Hargadon A.B., Enhancing creativity through “mindless” work: A framework of workday design, Organization Science, 17, 4, pp. 470-483, (2006); Feurer R.C.K., Wargin J., Developing creative teams, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 16, 1, pp. 5-18, (1996); Fine C.H., Vardan R., Pethick R., El Hout J., Rapid-response capability in value chain design, MIT Sloan Manage Rev, 43, pp. 69-75, (2002); Fleischer M., Liker J.K., Concurrent engineering effectiveness, (1997); Gupta R., Banerjee S., Distraction or enrichment?

Grenoble Alpes, Inria, CNRS, Grenoble INP, LIG, Grenoble, France","Network slice management and, more generally, resource orchestration should be fully automated in 6G networks, as envisioned by the ETSI ENI. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and context-aware policies are certainly major options to move in this direction and to adapt service delivery to changing user needs, environmental conditions and business objectives. In this paper, we step towards this objective by addressing the problem of optimal placement of dynamic virtual networks through a self-adaptive learning-based strategy. These constantly evolving networks present, however, several challenges, mainly due to their stochastic nature, and the high dimensionality of the state and the action spaces. This curse of dimensionality requires, indeed, a broader exploration, which is not always compatible with a real-time execution in an operational network. Thus, we propose DQMC, a new strategy for virtual network embedding in mobile networks combining a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) strategy, namely a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Monte Carlo (MC). As learning is costly in time and computing resources, and sensitive to changes in the network, we suggest a control-theory-based techniques to dynamically leverage exploration in DQMC. This leads to fast, efficient, and sober learning compared to a Monte Carlo-based strategy. This also ensures a reliable solution even in the case of a change in the requests’ sizes or a node's failure, showing promising perspectives for solutions combining control-theory and machine learning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","5G slicing; Control theory; Deep reinforcement learning; Monte Carlo; Virtual network embedding","5G mobile communication systems; Computation theory; Deep learning; E-learning; Monte Carlo methods; Network embeddings; Robust control; Stochastic systems; 5g slicing; Context-aware policies; Deep reinforcement learning; Exploration strategies; Fully automated; Monte carlo; Reinforcement learnings; Robust control theory; Service delivery; Virtual network embedding; Reinforcement learning","","","","","ADR, (VX/BL/LEG/E/17/00484)","Funding from the ADR research action:Organisation name: NokiaContract: VX/BL/LEG/E/17/00484.","NGMN Alliance, Description of Network Slicing Concept: Tech. rep., (2016); Rkhami A., Hadjadj-Aoul Y., Outtagarts A., Learn to improve: A novel deep reinforcement learning approach for beyond 5G network slicing, 2021 IEEE 18th Annual Consumer Communications Networking Conference, CCNC, pp. 1-6, (2021); Quang P.T.A., Hadjadj-Aoul Y., Outtagarts A., A deep reinforcement learning approach for VNF forwarding graph embedding, IEEE Trans.

It provides an instructional and comprehensive explanation of the structure of the financial system as a network of risk suppliers and risk consumers, where different categories of market participants buy, transform, net, and re-sell different kinds of risks. This risk-transformation oriented view is supported by the changes that followed the last global financial crisis: consumers of financial products asked for less complex risk transformations, regulators demanded limiting risks inside financial institutions to the maximum extent possible, and market participants turned to run mass market-like businesses and away from bespoke ""haute couture""-like businesses. This book portrays the network of intermediaries that compose the financial system, describes their most common business models, explains the exact role of each kind of market participant, and underlines the interaction between them. It seeks to reveal the potential disintermediation that could occur inside the financial sector, led by FinTechs and Artificial Intelligence-based innovations. Readers are invited to reconsider the role of market participants in the post-crisis world and are prepared for the next wave of changes driven by data science, AI, and blockchain. Amid these innovations, quantitative finance will be increasingly involved in all aspects of the financial system. This handy resource helps practitioners from both the buy-side and sell-side gain insights to, and provides an overview of, business models in the financial system from an intermediation perspective, and guides students to comprehensively understand the complex ecosystem in which they will evolve. © 2022 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

This study empirically explores the capabilities of AI and BT to ascertain its role in financial resilience of a supply chain. Further study considers the environmental dynamism moderating the relationship of AI and BT leading to financial resilience of supply chains. Adopting a multi-methodological approach, we conduct an empirical and qualitative study to explore the relationship between AI, BT, and the financial resilience of supply chains. For data collection, 202 survey responses from supply chain professionals were collected to test the theoretical model, whereas the qualitative study collected responses from 25 supply chain professionals using semi-structured interviews and the grounded approach. After using structural equation modeling for the quantitative data analysis, our findings indicate that, compared to artificial intelligence, blockchain technology is stronger in facilitating financial resilience of a supply chain under the moderating influence of environmental dynamism. Thematic analysis for the qualitative study indicate the role of AI in sensing, blockchain in seizing and financial resilience in reconfiguring the opportunities lie in supply chain. AI is suitable for sensing the business environment and facilitating blockchain deployment. This study offers a theoretical contribution, along with practical implications for managers. © 2023","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain technology; Dynamic technological capability view; Environmental dynamism; Financial resilience","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Environmental technology; Finance; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Dynamic technological capability view; Emerging technologies; Environmental dynamisms; Financial resilience; Methodological approach; Qualitative study; Technological capability; Uncertainty; Supply chains","","","","","","","Aitzhan N.Z., Svetinovic D., Security and privacy in decentralized energy trading through multi-signatures, blockchain and anonymous messaging streams, IEEE Trans.

AI-based recruitment tools are changing the way recruitment processes are conducted. However, the perception of AI technology from the candidate's perspective has received limited coverage in the literature. Since little is known about how applicants experience AI-enabled recruitment, this paper explores their experiences and perceptions in hiring processes. The results of this study show that applicants perceive AI technology positively in hiring processes and see it as useful and easy to use. In terms of advantages, reduced response time was recognized as the most significant benefit. The lack of nuance in human judgment, low accuracy and reliability, and immature technology were identified as the biggest drawbacks of AI in recruitment. © 2023 The Author","AI; Applicants' perception; Artificial intelligence; Human resources; Recruitment; TAM","","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","AI is one of the most innovative technologies to emerge in HR, and it can be very effective and useful, especially in recruitment (Vedapradha et al., 2019). It helps reduce or eliminate time-consuming activities, streamline and automate resume reviews, match job requirements and candidates' existing skills more efficiently and effectively, and enable timely decision-making (Vedapradha et al., 2019). In order to realize the full potential of AI in the recruitment process, any AI-based decisions/recommendations must rely on the original inputs (e.g. scope) the programmers set prior to the interaction with the potential candidate rather than have either humans or other AI tools adding inputs during the interaction phase (Jennings & Wooldridge, 1998). AI has been successfully used in visual perception, natural language processing, speech recognition, speech-to-text conversion, and other areas. Below are some AI-enabled hiring tools that have been integrated into the hiring process as identified by Vedapradha et al. (2019): Hirevue: The U.S.-based company uses video intelligence to analyze video interviews of job applicants and provide employers with more insights to make faster decisions. In support of HRM, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) found that using AI-enhanced HR processes allowed them to complete 86% of HR tasks without human intervention (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018).The results of this study indicate that applicants have a positive perception of AI technology in hiring processes. The TAM technology acceptance criteria, Perceived Usefulness, and Ease of Use influence the acceptance of AI technology and the willingness of applicants to participate in AI-driven recruitments. Similar results on users' satisfaction with AI tools in recruitment and the perceived attractiveness of companies using these tools in hiring processes further support the use of AI in HR. The advantages and disadvantages of this technology from the users' perspective also have some practical implications. Regarding benefits, about 70% of applicants mentioned reduced response time as the significant advantage, followed by ease of use, improved quality and objectivity of the hiring process, and better user experience. The major disadvantage of AI technology, also mentioned by almost 70% of respondents, concerns the AI lack of nuance in human judgment or human touch, followed by low accuracy and reliability, immature technology manifesting itself in biases in algorithms, speech/text recognition, inadequate optimization for video interviews, and lack of transparency when interacting with AI. Other drawbacks relate to ethical concerns, privacy implications, and legal issues. The identified weaknesses in the current stage of AI development could help HR practitioners and software developers improve AI tools and support their effective adoption in the HR environment.","Ajzen I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior, Action control, pp. 11-39, (1985); Albakry S., Vaniea K., Wolters M.K., What is this URL's destination?

To this end, the innovative approach of combining bibliometric analysis with an extensive literature review was used. Bibliometric data from 4335 documents were analysed, and 229 articles published in leading IS journals were reviewed. The bibliometric analysis revealed that research on AI in e-commerce focuses primarily on recommender systems. Sentiment analysis, trust, personalisation, and optimisation were identified as the core research themes. It also places China-based institutions as leaders in this researcher area. Also, most research papers on AI in e-commerce were published in computer science, AI, business, and management outlets. The literature review reveals the main research topics, styles and themes that have been of interest to IS scholars. Proposals for future research are made based on these findings. This paper presents the first study that attempts to synthesise research on AI in e-commerce. For researchers, it contributes ideas to the way forward in this research area. To practitioners, it provides an organised source of information on how AI can support their e-commerce endeavours. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig.","Artificial intelligence; Bibliometrics; e-commerce; Literature review","","","","","","","","Detecting fake websites: The contribution of statistical learning theory, MIS Quarterly, 34, 3, pp. 435-461, (2010); Abdel-Karim B.M., Pfeuffer N., Hinz O., Machine learning in information systems - a bibliographic review and open research issues, Electronic Markets, 31, 3, pp. 643-670, (2021); Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J.C., Curley S.P., Zhang J., Do Recommender Systems Manipulate Consumer Preferences?

A huge population of humanity still lacks basic access to the necessary healthcare diagnostic facilities, the first step to curbing diseases and mortality rates. One such example is the Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, a technology discovered in 1950s, miniaturised to fit in 50kg for the International Space Station, yet there are 36000 MRI scanners worldwide, even Japan with most MRI Scanners have only 51 scanners per million people India, the second largest country in the world, has 1 scanner per million people. The cost of an MRI scan is USD 4000, with nearly 80,000 scans a year in India. The numbers clearly indicate the economic restrictions to diagnostic access, which this work intends to change through commercial viability assessment of leveraging space technology and operational advancements to equalize access to MRI diagnostics, utilizing the support schemes and low cost manufacturing and skilled workforce capabilities inherent to India and other developing nations, coupled with Halbach array electromagnets to provide multi mode imaging capabilities to cater to different imaging performance needs while concentrating maximum field in bore, miniaturized SAR RF systems with satellite SDR kits for generating gradients at lower costs and processing difficulties, eliminating cryogenic fluid requirements to substantially decrease costs and architectural and infrastructural requirements in hospitals and imaging centres, cloud computing to leverage techniques of processing multi node data input terminals powered by deep learning algorithms powering neural networks and AI along with network architectures to ensure fast, safe and redundant data processing and provision to doctors and patients to reduce image processing and radiological comprehension costs and difficulties, amongst other technologies from R&D and innovations proven in space, minus the stringent and expensive space grade qualifications, with international business models and SpaceX-inspired supply chain operations strategy of indigenous manufacturing of all components and assembly under one roof for quick time to market, low cost, portability, decreased cost to hospitals and patients without compromising performance, sustainability and commercial viability in a nation lacking such an ecosystem. This work radically catalyses the germination of an MRI ecosystem in India and other developing nations, hence spearheading the mission of equalizing health access using space technologies. © 2022 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

The Space/Gradient-Free MRI work focuses on the development and application of new developments in MRI technology that will result in an MRI that is an order of magnitude lighter and cheaper than existing MRIs. The first gradient-free MRI (named the ""Sparrow MRI"") was built in late 2014. It is also wrist-sized and it uses a rotating non-uniform magnet with spatial-encoding RF receive coils. Its magnet weighs about 2 kg. The study phase for the ISS-MRI, was funded by the Canadian Space Agency under one of the ISS Life Science Research System contracts, from January 6, 2014 to June 4, 2014. The proposed ISS-MRI was a wrist-sized MRI, approximately 50 kg, to fly on the International Space Station (ISS) 18 months after the build phase was funded. The applications of portable MRIs include deployment in remote rural and northern locations, developing countries, disaster and war zones. A Gradient-Free MRI will also have applications in small X-ray clinics, nursing homes, the Emergency Room where it would be safer for children than X-ray CT, and in the Operating Room where it will be useful for minimally invasive surgery and futuristic robotic surgery. The Portable MRI concept is based on three strongly Canadian technological innovations: 1. Gradient-free MRI: Spatial encoding is achieved through the manipulation of transmitted RF rather than through magnetic field gradients. This technology - call TRASE - was originally developed at Canada's NRC Institute for Biodiagnostics (IBD). Our group works closely with one of the original inventors of TRASE: Jonathan Sharp at the University of Alberta. Traditional magnetic field gradient hardware is complex, heavy and requires large amounts of electrical power because it needs to modify a vary large magnetic field. RF, on the other hand, requires very low power and simple hardware because it takes advantage of nuclear magnetic resonance. MRI in space is now technically possible (TRL = 4) because of the low mass, low power requirements and high reliability that RF encoding offers. 2. Halbach magnet geometries: Using permanent magnets instead of superconducting magnets also reduces mass and complexity. Halbach geometries also eliminate the magnetic stray field which is necessary for safe operation in space. Proprietary geometries with uniform magnetic fields have been developed by MRI-TECH Canada in collaboration with AMag of Poland. A uniform field magnet is proposed for the Space Station wrist MRI. Proprietary geometries with non-uniform magnetic fields have been developed by LT Imaging Inc.","Paterson A., The pros and cons of imaging options, (2001); Penlon, A Brief History of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, (2022); Mackiewich B., MR Imaging and Data Characteristics, (1995); National Inventors Hall of Fame, Raymond V.

It has the potential to radically transform the business landscape, with consequences for operations and supply chain management (O&SCM). However, empirical evidence on Gen-AI's effects in O&SCM remains limited. This study investigates the benefits, challenges, and trends associated with Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. We collected data from O&SCM practitioners in the UK (N = 154) and the USA (N = 161). As we used the organizational learning theory for the research, our findings reveal increased efficiency as a significant benefit for both adopters and non-adopters in both countries, while indicating security, risks, and ethical as prominent concerns. In particular, it appeared that the integration of Gen-AI/ChatGPT leads to the enhancement of the overall supply chain performance. Moreover, organizational learning can speed up the results of Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. No wonders that adopters express their satisfaction about the post-implementation benefits of the technology, which include reduced perceived challenges for pre-implementation, and greater optimism about future Gen-AI/ChatGPT utilization compared to non-adopters. Adopters also display diverse behavioral patterns toward efficiency, agility, responsiveness, etc. This study provides valuable insights for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers interested in comprehending Gen-AI/ChatGPT's implications in O&SCM for both adopters and non-adopters. Additionally, it underscores the importance of organizational learning processes in facilitating successful Gen-AI/ChatGPT adoption in O&SCM. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","ChatGPT; Disruptive technology; Emerging technologies; Generative artificial intelligence; Operations and supply chain management; Organizational learning","Efficiency; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Supply chain management; ChatGPT; Disruptive technology; Emerging technologies; Generative artificial intelligence; Learning Theory; Operations and supply chain managements; Organizational learning; Security risks; Speed up; Supply chain performance; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Abdulai A., Hung L., Will ChatGPT Undermine Ethical Values in Nursing Education, Research, and Practice?, (2023); Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., ChatGPT and how AI disrupts industries, Harv.

This situation has been reached by powerful data partitioning and data allocation techniques and algorithms. By analyzing these findings closely, we figure out that they are quickly stressed by the workload changes, which represents the usual case of business analytics applications. To deal with this challenge in the context of big data warehouses, several studies proposed to move to another processing paradigm outside the DBMS realm such as Spark by proposing adaptive partitioning solutions to tackle the workload changes. The majority of approaches are offline and those that are online cause significant random disk I/O costs. This is because the correlation that may exist between jobs and data blocks read from the disk is not captured to refine the adaptive partitioning algorithms. This represents one of the major causes of providing high performance of dynamic workloads. To solve such limitations, we propose in this paper a proactive framework for query-aware adaptive partitioning (called PROADAPT) that uses an AI-inspired methodology that can be connected to any query optimizer managing partitioned data. This methodology uses a genetic algorithm to solve our formalized problem that considers the interaction that may exist among workload queries. PROADAPT intensively rewrites queries by exploiting dimension hierarchies to skip irrelevant data and then improves I/O performance. Different technical modules of our framework are discussed. Finally, we conduct intensive experiments on Postgres-XL and a Spark SQL parallel cluster to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dimension's hierarchies; Multidimensional partitioning; Self-adaptive partitioning; Utility maximization; Workload clustering","Big data; Data handling; Genetic algorithms; Adaptive partitioning; Clusterings; Data allocation; Data partitioning; Dimension hierarchies; Multidimensional partitioning; Performance; Self-adaptive partitioning; Utility maximizations; Workload clustering; Data warehouses","","","","","","","Ozsu M.T., Valduriez P., Principles of Distributed Database Systems, (2020); Agrawal S., Narasayya V.R., Yang B., Integrating vertical and horizontal partitioning into automated physical database design, ACM SIGMOD, pp. 359-370, (2004); Curino C., Zhang Y., Jones E.P.C., Madden S., Schism: a workload-driven approach to database replication and partitioning, Proc.

However, IoT devices alone tend to strain enterprise systems with a sheer volume of unstructured and unfiltered data. To overcome this challenge, endowing (smart) devices with AI-based capabilities can significantly enhance enterprise system capabilities. However, deploying AI-based capabilities on potentially insecure edge hardware and platforms introduces new security risks, including AI model theft, poisoning, and data leaks. This paradigm shift necessitates the protection of distributed AI applications and data. In this paper, we propose a solution for safeguarding the Intellectual Property and data privacy of ML-based software. We utilize hardware-assisted Privacy Enhancing Technologies, specifically Trusted Execution Environments. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of ML-based motion detection in CCTV cameras.

Extracting key-value information from business documents is a challenging problem due to the variety of document types and templates, in this work we will deal with the problem as a graph node classification problem using a multi “graph transformer"" layers, we propose a graph construction method that focuses on the most relevant neighbours of every node while reducing the size of the graph and we use a document transformer embedding combined with some spatial and textual feature to give a better representation to each node. Our contribution in this work was to conceive a graph neural network (GNN) achieving the highest results comparing to the rest of GNN models dealing with the same problem to our knowledge, the model is small (53,6K parameters) comparing to the recent models using transformers architectures (hundreds of millions of parameters) which is very suitable for applications when storage constraints are present, it also has a limited impact on the environment and represent an alternative to build greener AI systems. We experiment our model on the SROIE ICDAR receipts dataset where we got an important F1 score compared to other graph neural network (GNN) based models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Document information extraction; GNN; Transformers","Classification (of information); Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Information systems; Information use; Multilayer neural networks; Neural network models; Business documents; Database tables; Document information extraction; Feature models; Graph neural networks; Key values; Manual processing; Neural network features; Transformer; XML-database; Graph neural networks","","","","","","","O'Gorman L., The document spectrum for page layout analysis, IEEE Trans.

We begin with an overview of the regulatory landscape, or lack thereof, and then call out the specific provisions of EU data protection law applicable to AI while focusing on examples of country-specific approaches, including some recent regulatory action. This regulatory action is particularly insightful since it identifies the key challenges that companies face, or will eventually face, when adopting AI-based solutions. These challenges include how to anticipate and prevent bias in automated decision making (ADM) and how to provide transparency to data subjects, despite the complexity of machine learning processes, while protecting business secrets and know-how. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

In this study, we utilize the bibliometric method to review the supply side, demand side, the platform, and their optimization models. Based on the bibliometric network, we propose a complete multi-level framework to study the optimization decisions of stakeholders and the key factors that may influence optimal decisions in the sharing economy. The pricing, behavioral characteristics, operating strategies, and incentive methods of the three stakeholders will affect the optimal decisions and models. Multi-party interaction significantly affects the decision-making behavior of stakeholders. The sharing economy introduces a new business model to traditional industrial applications, such as transportation and trade, and has both positive and negative effects on the economy, environment, and society. We identify future research in the ecosystem of the sharing economy, hybrid methods, and breakthrough technologies, such as blockchain, AI, and data-driven optimization. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometric method; Multi-level framework; Operations research; Optimization decision; Sharing economy","Decision making; Bibliometric; Bibliometric method; Bibliometrics analysis; Multi-level framework; Multilevels; Operation research; Optimal decisions; Optimisations; Optimization decision; Sharing economy; Operations research","","","","","AIM Institute; Business Intelligence Center; Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences, (22YJC630009); Jinan Office of Philosophy and Social Science, (2022CJJ132); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71874131); Ministry of Education Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, (20JZD024)","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project ( 71874131 ), the Ministry of Education Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of China (20JZD024), the Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences ( 22YJC630009 ), and the Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project of Henan ( 2022CJJ132 ).

Focusing on an innovative AV design (AD) concept, this paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain-based Smart Contracts can enhance sustainable supply chain operations. A novel design element, Margin Indicator (MI), is developed to obtain reliable predictive analytics results from the mainstream machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach supports a robust control of costs and energy, while maintaining a high level of transparency in managing decentralized AV supply chain processes, monetary impacts, and environmental sustainability. Testing the developed concept through a preliminary case study, we observed a reduction in energy wastage and hidden financial transactions by 12.48% and 11.58%, respectively. Supported by the rapid advancement in the blockchain and AI technologies, the developed framework is expected to improve product traceability, transaction transparency, and sustainable economic growth for the AV supply chains. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous vehicle; Blockchain; Digital supply chain; Smart contract; Sustainable logistics","algorithm; artificial intelligence; economic growth; experimental design; machine learning; supply chain management; sustainable development; technology adoption","","","","","","","Abdel-Basset M., Moustafa N., Hawash H., Razzak I., Sallam K.M., Elkomy O.M., Federated intrusion detection in blockchain-based smart transportation systems, IEEE Trans.

Due to rapid technological development, synchronization of information systems, and industrialization, corporate managers increasingly adopt AI in innovation. In response, scholars are interested in the idea of creating and mapping the intersection of AI in corporate innovation, which resulted in massive literature during the past decades. To critically analyze the phenomena of AI in corporate innovation, we conducted a hybrid review of published literature (364 articles) for the last 56 years (1996 to July 2022). We present taxonomy, outline AI phases, AI large scope definition, and link with innovation. We identify eight focal fields in the intersection of AI in corporate innovation, such as AI and business models (BM), AI and product innovation, AI and open innovation, AI and innovation process, AI and firm's innovation structure, AI, firm's knowledge and innovation, and AI, innovation and firm market performance, and AI and innovativeness of supply chain management. We outline a framework encompassing the role of AI in corporate innovation. We conclude this study by identifying influential aspects of literature and presenting future research agendas. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Bibliometrics analysis, content analysis; Business model; Corporate innovation; Review","Supply chain management; Bibliometric analyse, content analyse; Bibliometrics analysis; Business models; Content analysis; Corporate innovation; Corporates; Industrialisation; Innovations process; Research agenda; Technological development; artificial intelligence; business; corporate strategy; innovation; modeling; research; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Aas T.H., Breunig K.J., Conceptualizing innovation capabilities: a contingency perspective, J.

It discusses Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. For each of three major A&F functions – financial accounting, management accounting, and control and treasury – the influences of these technologies are analysed. The present day seems decisive for the A&F profession, concerning how it may evolve, expand or lose relevance to other competing professions. Variations of accounting hybridisation and the ‘business partner’ role emerge. A new hybridisation is unfolding between the A&F and information technology (IT)/data science, and the ‘business partner’ role may be taken by professionals coming from the latter area. In fact, A&F professionals lack increasingly required IT and data science skills, and companies are turning to hire IT and data science professionals to deliver these high value-added contributions. Therefore, A&F professionals should upskill to at least a basic level, increasingly required for core activities of A&F and to interact within multidisciplinary teams. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Erik Strauss and Martin Quinn;

It exacerbates inventory distortion because of significant revenue loss caused by stock-level issues. Despite the availability of several forecasting techniques, large organisations, manufacturing firms, and e-commerce websites collectively lose around $1.8 trillion annually to inventory distortion. If this problem is solved, sales may increase by 10.3 percent. The businesses are concerned about mitigating this loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a significant role in building resilient supply chains. However, developing AI models consumes time and cost. In this paper, we propose a No Code Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) enabling non-technical companies to build machine learning models based on production quantity and inventory replenishment. The development of the NCAI model is fast and inexpensive. However, little research deals with applying NCAI to operations and supply chain problems. Addressing the existing gap, we show the application of NCAI in the retail industry. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Inventory distortion; No-Code Artificial Intelligence (NCAI);

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital technologies applications continue to emerge to enhance and improve novel ways of communication on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Indeed, this has caused a change in the behavioral and social customer journey, where customers need to embrace a digital experience adoption. The AI applications primarily aim to study the shoppers browsing trend to draw new clients and expand businesses. Even the fashion industry has tapped into Instagram's business benefits in this fast-paced and competitive industry. With this quick and compelling way to capture shoppers’ attention towards fashion products, the purchase decision may differ between e-shoppers and conventional shoppers. AI seems to be extremely promising and has the potential to be a game changer for Instagram users, advertisers, and influencers. This study applies the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) theory to investigate the effects of AI-based digital technology experiences on Instagrammers’ fashion apparel purchase decisions - perceived eWOM, perceived emotional value, perceived quality, perceived risk and perceived price. Based on data collected from Instagram users, the framework of this study was evaluated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Semi-structured in-depth interviews were also conducted as part of the research to get a more in-depth understanding of the profiles and behaviors of Instagram users. Our findings from both methodologies confirm that perceived emotional value, perceived quality, and perceived eWOM revealed a statistically significant and positive influence on Instagrammers’ purchase decisions for fashion apparel. Meanwhile, the importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified perceived emotional value as the most important factor for Instagrammers, but the highest performance was perceived quality. This research has important implications for Malaysian online retailers and shoppers to adapt to the fast-changing digital transformation. Assuredly, this study makes a noteworthy contribution to attitudinal research on social media commerce within the fashion industry. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","AI; Digital transformation; Fashion; Instagram; Purchase decision","Behavioral research; Quality control; Sales; Apparel industry; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Fashion; Fashion industry; Instagram; Online social networkings; Perceived quality; Purchase decision; Technological advancement; artificial intelligence; clothing industry; competitiveness; decision making; social media; technological change; technological development; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Akhlaq A., Ahmed E., Digital commerce in emerging economies–Factors associated with online shopping intentions in Pakistan, Int.

In recent times firms have shown an increased interest in designing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactional technologies, such as conversational AI agents and chatbots, that obviate the need for having human service agents for the provision of customer service. However, the business impact of conversational AI is contingent on customers using and adequately engaging with these tools. This engagement depends, in turn, on conversational AI’s similarity, or likeness to the human beings it is intended to replace. Businesses therefore need to understand what human-like characteristics and competencies should be embedded in customer-facing conversational AI agents to facilitate smooth user interaction. This focus on “human-likeness” for facilitating user engagement in the case of conversational AI agents is in sharp contrast to most prior information systems (IS) user engagement research, which is predicated on the “instrumental value” of information technology (IT). Grounding our work in the individual human competency and media naturalness literatures, we theorize the key role of human-like interactional competencies in conversational AI agents—specifically, cognitive, relational, and emotional competencies—in facilitating user engagement. We also hypothesize the mediating role of user trust in these relationships. Following a sequential mixed methods approach, we use a quantitative two-wave, survey-based study to test our model. We then examine the results in light of findings from qualitative follow-up interviews with a sampled set of conversational AI users. Together, the results offer a nuanced understanding of desirable human-like competencies in conversational AI agents and the salient role of user trust in fostering user engagement with them. We also discuss the implications of our study for research and practice. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","AI; Artificial Intelligence; chatbot; conversational agents; human-like competencies; human-like trust; media naturalness theory; mixed methods; user engagement","Sales; Artificial intelligence agent; Chatbots; Conversational agents; Human like; Human-like competency; Human-like trust; Medium naturalness theory; Mixed method; User engagement; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Fondation HEC","Shirish C.

The use and application of Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for different business process aims is often discussed and put in place, yet it can have a negative impact if DS and AI are implemented in the wrong way. We discuss the use of DS and AI for the identification, verification, and improvement of business processes, and how to ensure responsible DS and AI use in enterprises for this aim. We propose an information system design for responsible and trustworthy business processes, and we envision that businesses will need strong and well-defined control points in their information systems for managing processes and creating associated audits to enforce their principles. We define questions and challenges companies need to reflect on and follow for an application of responsible DS and AI in the enterprise context. © 2023 Proceedings of the 16th IADIS International Conference on Information Systems 2023, IS 2023.

However, algorithms often fail to perform as expected due to various data, model, and market biases. Motivated by this challenge, this study presents a framework of algorithmic bias management capabilities for industrial markets that contribute to customer equity in terms of value, brand and relationship equity. Drawing on the dynamic capability theory, this study fills this gap by conducting a literature review, thematic analysis, and two rounds of surveys (n=200 analytics professionals and n=200 business customers) in the financial service industry in Australia. The findings show that algorithmic bias management capability consists of three primary dimensions (data, model, and deployment capabilities) and nine subdimensions. These findings have important implications for scholars and managers interested in developing algorithmic bias management capabilities to influence customer equity in industrial markets. © 2023 The Authors","AI-driven marketing analytics; Algorithmic bias; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","","Federal Government ends Robodebt class action with settlement worth $1.2 billion, (2020); Adam M., Wessel M., Benlian A., AI-based chatbots in customer service and their effects on user compliance, Electronic Markets, 31, 2, pp. 427-445, (2021); Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J., Curley S.P., Zhang J., Ransbotham S., The hidden side effects of recommendation systems, MIT Sloan Management Review, 60, 2, (2019); Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., Trustworthiness in mHealth information services: An assessment of a hierarchical model with mediating and moderating effects using partial least squares (PLS), Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62, 1, pp. 100-116, (2011); Akter S., Dwivedi Y.K., Biswas K., Michael K., Bandara R.J., Sajib S., Addressing algorithmic bias in AI-driven customer management, Journal of Global Information Management (JGIM), 29, 6, pp. 1-27, (2021); Akter S., Dwivedi Y.K., Sajib S., Biswas K., Bandara R.J., Michael K., Algorithmic bias in machine learning-based marketing models, Journal of Business Research, 144, pp. 201-216, (2022); Akter S., Fosso Wamba S., Dewan S., Why PLS-SEM is suitable for complex modelling?

To this end, we propose an original conceptual framework based on the idea of a sustainable growth driven by the interplay between AI and HRM. Current academic debate is overly concerned by the impact that future AI will have on business and society. One of the central aspects of the conversation is whether or not AI will replace humans in value-added activities. The study remarks that humanoids are an amplificator of human potential, in light of a human-centered approach. In this vein, present work reconceptualizes the tenets of society 5.0 by considering the category of “innovation ventura”, the evolution of the innovative enterprise in the next AI landscape. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Humans –humanoid interactions; Innovation; Service robot deployment model; Society 5.0; Technology acceptance model","","","","","","Manlio Del Giudice; Veronica Scuotto Beatrice Orlando; National Research University Higher School of Economics, ВШЭ","Funding text 1: The article is based on the study funded by the Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and by the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'.

With the proliferation of digital computing devices and the emergence of big data, AI is increasingly offering significant opportunities for society and business organizations. The growing interest of scholars and practitioners in AI has resulted in the diversity of research topics explored in bulks of scholarly literature published in leading research outlets. This study aims to map the intellectual structure and evolution of the conceptual structure of overall AI research published in Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TF&SC). This study uses machine learning-based structural topic modeling (STM) to extract, report, and visualize the latent topics from the AI research literature. Further, the disciplinary patterns in the intellectual structure of AI research are examined with the additional objective of assessing the disciplinary impact of AI. The results of the topic modeling reveal eight key topics, out of which the topics concerning healthcare, circular economy and sustainable supply chain, adoption of AI by consumers, and AI for decision-making are showing a rising trend over the years. AI research has a significant influence on disciplines such as business, management, and accounting, social science, engineering, computer science, and mathematics. The study provides an insightful agenda for the future based on evidence-based research directions that would benefit future AI scholars to identify contemporary research issues and develop impactful research to solve complex societal problems. © 2023 The Author(s)","AI; Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Machine learning; Research agenda; Structural topic modeling; Topic modeling","Behavioral research; Big data; Decision making; Digital devices; Machine learning; Supply chains; Artificial intelligence research; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Machine-learning; Research agenda; Research topics; Social changes; Structural topic modeling; Topic Modeling; artificial intelligence; decision making; health care; machine learning; research; social change; technological development; trend analysis; Data Analytics","","","","","","","Abdel-Basset M., Chang V., Nabeeh N.A., An intelligent framework using disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis, Technol.

In terms of convenience, consumers benefit from the generation of customized ad content through their activities on social network sites (SNS). However, concerns about data privacy and impaired well-being remain, notably in relation to Generation Z consumers, who are considered tech-savvy, narcissistically-oriented, and vulnerable in their SNS usage. Drawing on cognitive dissonance theory, we show how a dilemma of convenience vs. privacy drives their technology dissonance and their dependence on SNS. Our empirical study in the US demonstrates the trade-off between convenience and privacy that results from the customizability of technology, the opposite functions of these facets in technology dissonance, and the negative impact on SNS dependence. When the key role of the ego in the dissonance in Generation Z's SNS behavior is recognized, vulnerable narcissism is found to show nuances of psychological dissonance induced by privacy concerns. Our findings enhance the discussion on the customizability of AI-enabled technology by indicating how advertisers can improve targeted marketing and ensure the well-being of Generation Z consumers. © 2023 The Author(s)","Cognitive dissonance; Convenience; Narcissism; Personalized advertising; Privacy concern; SNS dependence","","","","","","Major Humanities and Social Sciences Research Projects in Zhejiang higher education institutions, (2023QN033); Ningbo Social Science Research Base Project, (JD5-FZ38); Zhejiang Soft Science Programme, (2022C35003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71972112, 72101131)","The authors acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [No. 71972112, 72101131], the fifth round of Ningbo Social Science Research Base Project [No. JD5-FZ38], Major Humanities and Social Sciences Research Projects in Zhejiang higher education institutions [No. 2023QN033] and Zhejiang Soft Science Programme [No. 2022C35003].

In this context, omnichannel integration quality (OIQ) aims to provide seamless service experience across multiple channels, where adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) will play a vital role. The existing research has primarily focused on the consumer space which leads to a gap in our understanding on the role of organisational intangible resources, employees, and AI adoption to achieve OIQ and business productivity. To bridge this gap, we use resource-based view and socio-technical systems as theoretical lenses for developing a theoretical model, which is tested by surveying 170 healthcare professionals in Ghana. Our findings highlight the importance of developing strategies that will help translate organisational resources into capabilities focusing on the employee-technology interface for effective omnichannel management and integration. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence; Business performance; Employee omnichannel adoption; Healthcare supply chain; Intangible resources; Omnichannel integration quality","","","","","","Grand Challenge Research Funds; Royal Academy of Engineering, UK Research and Innovation; Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG; Royal Society; British Council; Research Councils UK, RCUK; Horizon 2020; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: Prasanta Kumar Dey is Professor of Operations Management at Aston Business School.

Unlike other technologies, AI models keep dynamically improving based on past data. Most scholars have considered AI to be a strategic resource or technology in the organizational context. Most research on AI based on empirical evidence has been focussed on either its technological or resource-based aspects. Along with improved work efficiency, a looming sense of uncertainty is causing a dip in trust and transparency in business operations. Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) offers a solution suited to address this concern. RAI is a governance framework that documents how a specific organization addresses the challenges centred on AI from both the ethical and legal points of view. Few studies have attempted to explain how RAI could be used to swiftly improve trust and transparency. We set out to use fit viability theory and a selective organizational information privacy and security violations model (SOIPSVM) to answer two critical research questions. RQ 1: How does RAI help firms help improve supply chain coordination and supply chain performance? RQ 2: How does organizational culture moderate the relationships of RAI with fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency? To this end, we tested our hypotheses by means of empirical data collected from the Indian service sector using the Warp PLS 7.0 software. Our results help extend the theoretical base of fit viability theory to the context of RAI in micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector’s supply chain operations. The study also help MSMEs to understand the importance and application of RAI in improving their supply chain processes, which can help them reduce costs and improve efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Fit viability theory; Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI); Supply Chain Coordination; Supply Chain performance","","","","","","","","Acquisti A., Friedman A., Telang R., Is there a cost to privacy breaches?

Online news articles are one of the important information sources that present business news offered by various companies in the market every day all around the world. These news articles often cover the same events and report redundant information. Existing news platforms aim at collecting the key entities from news articles and providing a mechanism to view the latest and relevant business events based on user interest. However, they do not provide a method to model business events and understand them temporally, spatially, and contextually (i.e. changes in the event). For instance, it is crucial to know for how long a business event has been active? How important is its evolution locally, or worldwide? Or how did different companies come up with this event as competitors in the market? The contribution of this research is the exploration of the possibilities of modeling spatial, temporal, and contextual information evolution related to business events through the application of knowledge graphs and text analytics, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The constructed knowledge graphs through Named-Entity Recognition (NER), i.e., an NLP technique, present a compact news representation that tells the key entities of the business event at one glance using linked open data concepts. It enables the assessment of other related news events as well as provides the means for analysis of the influence and evolution of business events.  © 2022 ACM.","artificial intelligence (AI); business intelligence (BI);

We leverage the story of a high-growth startup, building and expanding on behavioral economics that examines the relationships between science and innovation, especially dynamic capabilities and related problemistic search and strategic options generation. A general framework for innovation shaped with both narrow and general AI (advanced data analytics, intelligent algorithms, etc.) is proposed to create and transform market offerings, hybridize domains heretofore dissociated and build organizational fit with prior and novel core elements. For firms, it can be exploitable as a competitive advantage, making it possible to efficiently anticipate, hence adapt to the most general types of change in representation or taking place in the environment. © 2022 European Academy of Management.","AI; creation of market offerings; decision-making; framework for innovation; problemistic search; strategic options generation organizational learning","","","","","","","","Aagaard A., Gertsen F., Supporting radical front-end innovation: Perceived key factors of pharmaceutical innovation, Creativity and Innovation Management, 20, 4, pp. 330-346, (2011); Aldieri L., Makkonen T., Concetto P.V., Environmental knowledge spillovers and productivity: A patent analysis for large international firms in the energy, water and land resources fields, Resources Policy, Elsevier, 69, C, (2020); Amabile T., Creativity, artificial Intelligence, and a world of surprises, Academy of Management Discoveries, 6, 3, pp. 351-354, (2019); Amarante M., Analogy in decision making, Mathematics of Operations Research, 40, 4, pp. 797-1088, (2015); Argote L., Greve H., A behavioral theory of the firm: 40 years and counting: Introduction and impact, Organization Science, 18, 3, pp. 337-349, (2007); Argyris C., Schon D., Organizational learning: A theory of action perspective, (1978); Ashburn T.T., Thor K.B., Drug repositioning: identifying and developing new uses for existing drugs, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 3, pp. 673-683, (2004); Augier M., Prietula M., Historical roots of the “a behavioral theory of the firm” model at GSIA, Organization Science, 18, 3, pp. 507-522, (2007); Aumann R., Interactive epistemology I: Knowledge, International Journal of Game Theory, 28, 3, pp. 263-300, (1999); Bar M., The proactive brain: Using analogies and associations to generate predictions, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, 7, pp. 280-289, (2007); Barney J.B., Strategic factor markets: Expectations, luck, and business strategy, Strategic Management Journal, 19, pp. 1231-1241, (1986); Barry F., Gorg H., Strobl E., Foreign direct investment, agglomerations, and demonstration effects: An empirical investigation, Review of World Economics, 139, 4, pp. 583-600, (2003); Beauzamy B., Archimedes' modern works, (2012); Bharadwaj A., El Sawy O.A., Pavlou P.A., Venkatraman N., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Boltzman L., Leçons sur la théorie des gaz, (1902); Botvinick M., Ritter S., Wang J.X., Kurth-Nelson Z., Blundell C., Hassabis D., Reinforcement learning, fast and slow, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 23, 5, pp. 408-422, (2019); Brem A., Viardot E., Revolution in innovation management: The digital breakthrough, Revolution of innovation management: the digital breakthrough, (2017); Cabana A., Pisarczyka K., Kopacza K., Kapusniaka A., Toumi M., Remuzatc C., Kornfeldc A., Filling the gap in CNS drug development: Evaluation of the role of drug Repurposing, Journal of Market Access and Health Policy, 5, 1, pp. 1-7, (2017); Caban A., Pisarczyk K., Kopacz K., Kapusniak A., Toumi M., Remuzat C., Kornfeld A., Filling the gap in CNS drug development: evaluation of the role of drug repurposing, Journal Of Market Access & Health Policy, 5, pp. 1-6, (2017); Calabretta G., Gemser G., Wijnberg N.M., The interplay between intuition and rationality in strategic decision making: A paradox perspective, Organization Studies, 38, 3-4, pp. 365-401, (2017); Carley K.M., Prietula M.J., ACTS theory: extending the model of bounded rationality, Computational Organization Theory, (1994); Chen H., Chiang R., Storey V.C., Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impacts, MIS Quarterly, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012); Chiva R., Ghauri P., Alegre J., Organizational learning, innovation and internationalization: A complex system model, British Journal of Management, 25, 4, pp. 687-705, (2014); Christensen C.M., The inventor's dilemna: When new technologies cause great firms to fail, (1997); Clausius R., Théorie mécanique de la chaleur, (1868); Cohen P., The discovery of forcing, Rocky Mountain Journal Of Mathematics., 32, 4, pp. 1071-1100, (2002); Colombo M.G., Rabbiosi L., Reichstein T., Special issue: “Designing internal organization for external knowledge sourcing”, European Management Review, 7, 1, pp. 74-76, (2010); Cyert R., March J.G., A behavioral theory of the firm, (1963); Davenport T., The AI advantage: how to put the artificial intelligence revolution to work, (2018); De Beaune A.S., L'Homme et l'outil.

Earth observation (EO) data, including satellite and in-situ, are essential for a number of applications, covering high-impact domains as diverse as security, agriculture, energy and health. In this paper, we present the AI4Copernicus framework for bridging the two domains within the European context to enable data-centred innovation. In order to achieve this goal, AI4Copernicus enriches the European AI-on-demand platform with a number of bootstrapping services and tools to accelerate uptake and innovation, whilst it provides integration over AI-on-Demand services and the Copernicus ecosystem over the highly successful Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) Cloud platforms. The AI4Copernicus framework is being used by a number of business-driven projects spanning several application domains.

The music business is being fundamentally changed by shrewd, intellectual methods that rely on AI. These tools make it very easy for musicians to create high-caliber music. Today, sophisticated and clever robots are capable of creating and composing music, one of the most fascinating and priceless works of human ingenuity. Intelligent programs based on artificial intelligence have enabled robots to create beautiful music without the involvement of any humans. The proposed article is focused on the usage of AI-grounded techniques for the learning of music and its classification. It shows that with new technologies, highly interactive interfaces and classrooms can now be developed for the effective and efficient teaching and learning of music. Almost all of the students favor the implementation of such methodologies to improve their performance in music learning and composition. The need for time to employ AI for the quick improvement of the students’ musical talent allows them to become professionals in their field. The design of animated courses with the integration of virtual reality and artificial intelligence can enhance the interest of students in learning and developing their skills. The study then acquired various important characteristics from the existing literature in the area of research and selected the most common ones. Then, with the implementation of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), these features are assigned weights. For the ranking of the alternatives, the method of multi-objective optimization on the basis of research analysis was utilized. AI-based methods in music education have several advantages and are revolutionizing how students learn about and interact with music. Personalized learning, accessible education, improved practice and performance, help with composition and arrangement, and music theory and analysis are some of the main benefits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Composing music; Interactive interfaces; Music learning","Curricula; Hierarchical systems; Intelligent robots; Multiobjective optimization; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Composing music; Intelligent programs; Interactive classroom; Interactive interfaces; Multi-objectives optimization; Music learning; Performance; Research analysis; Teaching and learning; Music","","","","","","","Chen W., Design of music teaching system based on artificial intelligence, Math Probl Eng, 2022, (2022); Cheng C., Xiao Y., Construction of AI environmental music education application model based on deep learning, J Environ Public Health, 2022, (2022); Chu X., Construction of artificial intelligence music teaching application model using deep learning, Mobile Inf Syst, 2022, (2022); Gong Y., Application of virtual reality teaching method and artificial intelligence technology in digital media art creation, Ecol Inf, 63, (2021); Guan Y., Ren F., Application of artificial intelligence and wireless networks to music teaching, Wirel Commun Mobile Comput, 2021, (2021); Han D., Kong Y., Han J., Wang G., A survey of music emotion recognition, Front Comput Sci, 16, 6, (2022); Hang Y., Khan S., Alharbi A., Nazir S., Assessing English teaching linguistic and artificial intelligence for efficient learning using analytical hierarchy process and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, J Softw Evol Process, (2022); Huang N., Ding X., Piano music teaching under the background of artificial intelligence, Wirel Commun Mobile Comput, 2022, (2022); Li M., Su Y., Evaluation of online teaching quality of basic education based on artificial intelligence, Int J Emerg Technol Learn (iJET), 15, 16, pp. 147-161, (2020); Moslem S., Celikbilek Y., An integrated grey AHP-MOORA model for ameliorating public transport service quality, Eur Transp Res Rev, 12, 1, (2020); Ng D.T.K., Ng E.H.L., Chu S.K.W., Engaging students in creative music making with musical instrument application in an online flipped classroom, Educ Inf Technol, 27, 1, pp. 45-64, (2022); Shi N., Wang Y., Symmetry in computer-aided music composition system with social network analysis and artificial neural network methods, J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput, (2020); Song R., Research on the application of computer multimedia music system in college music teaching, J Phys Conf Ser, 1744, 3, (2021); Tang Z., Technology to assist the application and visualization of digital media art teaching, For Chem Rev, pp. 1770-1787, (2022); Wang X., Design of vocal music teaching system platform for music majors based on artificial intelligence, Wirel Commun Mobile Comput, 2022, (2022); Wang X., Wang Q., Chen Y., Analysis of music online teaching curriculum arrangement based on BP neural network model, J Phys Conf Ser, 1648, 3, (2020); Wei J., Karuppiah M., Prathik A., College music education and teaching based on AI techniques, Comput Electr Eng, 100, (2022); Xu Y., The new media environment presents challenges and opportunities for music education in higher education, J Environ Public Health, 2022, (2022); Yang Y., Piano performance and music automatic notation algorithm teaching system based on artificial intelligence, Mobile Inf Syst, 2021, (2021); Yang G., Yang L., Exploration of vocal music teaching mode from the perspective of the age of artificial intelligence, Int J Front Eng Technol, 2, 1, pp. 31-40, (2020); Ye F., A study on music education based on artificial intelligence, IOP conference series: materials science and engineering, 750, 1, (2020); Zhang Z., Interactive teaching based on artificial intelligence and its application in improving national music appreciation ability, Math Probl Eng, 2022, (2022); Zhang Y., Yi D., A new music teaching mode based on computer automatic matching technology, Int J Emerg Technol Learn (iJET), 16, 16, pp. 117-130, (2021); Zhaoran S., Wireless processor application in home music teaching based on machine learning, Microprocess Microsyst, 80, (2021); Zhichao Z., Development of the music teaching system based on speech recognition and artificial intelligence, Secur Commun Netw, 2022, (2022)","I.

To achieve successful AI-CRM integration, companies must navigate a landscape filled with challenges and complexities marked by the distinctive nature of CRM processes. However, both academics and practitioners still face challenges in understanding the organizational and managerial elements crucial for successful AI-CRM integration. This study aims to fill this gap by identifying the challenges businesses must overcome in the process of AI integration in a CRM context, from the first discover phase to the final sustain phase. Since the context of AI-CRM integration encompasses expertise in artificial intelligence, customer relationship management, data science, and business management, we utilize a research approach that involves qualitative interviews with several actors (managers, consultants and specialists) across these domains to gain diverse insights into AI-CRM integration challenges and opportunities. We identified eleven specific challenges associated with AI-powered CRM and uncovered a temporal division of these challenges across the four phases of AI implementation. Furthermore, we have developed guidelines for addressing them effectively. The findings contribute to an empirical understanding of AI-CRM integration, offering a long-term perspective on leveraging AI for customer relationships. This research lays the foundation for exploring the activities and capabilities required to navigate the challenges of AI-CRM integration and provides essential questions for managers embarking on this journey. © 2023 The Authors","AI-CRM integration; Challenges; Innovation management; Qualitative research","","","","","","European Union Next-Generation EU, (1058 23/06/2022, ECS_00000043); European Commission, EC; Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD","Funding text 1: This research is linked to the fund cod.

This led to the emergence of malicious activities, also known as cyber-threats, targeting such systems. To counter these threats, new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been implemented and deployed. Today, AI is highly capable of delivering fast, precise, and reliable command-and-control decision-making, as well as providing reliable vulnerability analysis using well-proven cutting-edge techniques, at least when applied to terrestrial applications. In fact, this might not yet be the case when used for space applications. AI can also play a transformative and important role in the future of space cybersecurity, and it poses questions on what to expect in the near-term future. Challenges and opportunities deriving from the adoption of AI-based solutions to achieve cybersecurity and later cyber defence objectives in both civil and military operations require rethinking of a new framework and new ethical requirements. In fact, most of these technologies are not designed to be used or to overcome challenges in space. Because of the highly contested and congested environment, as well as the highly interdisciplinary nature of threats to AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, including cybersecurity issues, a solid and open understanding of the technology itself is required, as well as an understanding of its multidimensional uses and approaches. This includes the definition of legal and technical frameworks, ethical dimensions and other concerns such as mission safety, national security, and technology development for future uses. The continuous endeavours to create a framework and regulate interdependent uses of combined technologies such as AI and cybersecurity to counter “new” threats require the investigation and development of “living concepts” to determine in advance the vulnerabilities of networks and AI. This paper defines a cybersecurity risk and vulnerability taxonomy to enable the future application of AI in the space security field. Moreover, it assesses to what extent a network digital twins’ simulation can still protect networks against relentless cyber-attacks in space against users and ground segments. Both concepts are applied to the case study of Earth Observation (EO) operations, which allows for conclusions to be drawn based on the business impact (reputational, environmental, and social) of a cyber malicious activity. Since AI technologies are developing on a daily basis, a regulatory framework is proposed using ethical and technical approaches for this technology and its use in space. © 2023 International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety","Artificial intelligence; Cyber risk; Cybersecurity; Earth observation; Emerging disruptive technologies","","","","","","","","SERRANO I.; GEVAERT C.M., Explainable AI for earth observation: a review including societal and regulatory perspectives, Int.

The systematic review approach was applied to collect and analyze topics, and the literature search was conducted in two stages, encompassing 57 articles that met the research requirements. Our analysis reveals that AI's contribution to sustainability is concentrated within three key areas: organizational, technical, and processing aspects. The organizational aspect focuses on the integration of AI in companies and industries, addressing barriers to implementation and the relationship between companies, partners, and customers. The technical aspect highlights the development of AI algorithms that can address global challenges and contribute to the growth of stability and development in society. The processing aspect emphasizes the internal transformation of companies, their business models, and strategies in response to AI integration. Our proposed conceptual model outlines the essential elements organizations must consider when incorporating AI into their sustainability efforts, such as strategic alignment, infrastructure development, change management, and continuous improvement. By addressing these critical aspects, organizations can harness the potential of AI to drive positive social, environmental, and economic outcomes, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. The model serves as a comprehensive framework for organizations seeking to leverage AI for sustainable development, but it should be adapted to individual contexts to ensure its relevance and effectiveness. © 2023 The Authors.

In the past two years, several generative models have disrupted worldwide, including ChatGPT and DALL-E 2, developed by OpenAI, which are currently receiving significant media attention. These models can generate new content, respond to prompts, and automatically create new images and videos. Nevertheless, despite this progress of GAI, research into its application in business and industry is still in its infancy. Generative AI is bringing ground-breaking innovations that go beyond the limitations of conventional Contextual AI. This new type of AI can generate novel patterns in human-like creativity, encompassing various forms of content such as text, images, and media. It transforms how people communicate, create, and share content, taking organizations by surprise. Unfortunately, these organizations were not fully prepared as they were focused on the advancements and impacts of Contextual AI. Given the significant organizational-societal opportunities and challenges posed by generative models, it is crucial to comprehend their ramifications. However, the excessive hype surrounding GAI currently makes it difficult to determine how organizations can effectively utilize and regulate these powerful algorithms. In research, the primary question is how organizations can manage the intersection of human creativity and machine creativity, and how can they leverage this intersection to their advantage? To address this question and mitigate concerns related to it, a comprehensive understanding of GAI is essential. Therefore, this paper aims to provide technical insights into this paradigm and analyze its potential, opportunities, and constraints for business and industrial research. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","business; ChatGPT; Contextual Artificial Intelligence; DALL-E 2; Generative Artificial Intelligence; industry","Industrial research; Artificial intelligence research; Breakings; ChatGPT; Contextual artificial intelligence; DALL-E 2; Generative artificial intelligence; Generative model; ITS applications; Media attention; Novel patterns; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Akerkar R., Artificial Intelligence for Business, (2019); Ali H., Aysan A., What Will Chatgpt Revolutionize in Financial Industry, (2023); Arslan Kazan C., Koruca H., Chehbi Gamoura S., Dynamic data-driven failure mode effects analysis (FMEA) and fault prediction with real-time condition monitoring in manufacturing 4.0, ICAIAME 2021.

It is because online business-related data is growing over time. This increasing data demands more storage. But saving the irrelevant data will cost more to companies. To overcome the problems of data integration and scalability, the idea of Virtual Knowledge Graphs (VKGs) is exploited. Moreover, text processing methods based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) are utilized for improving the identification of relevant business news data. The contribution of this work is twofold that is presented using a business case study. First, we have applied the concept of VKG to expand the company database. The expansion is required for adding more business-related data from the news articles to improve the process of identifying its relevance as per the end-user's interests. Second, we have proposed the text relevance resolution matrix and its working is shown through NLP techniques for identifying relevant news data. Populating the modeled VKG with relevant news data will save database space and prevent manual labor. Moreover, it will also help business analysts to understand business data temporally, spatially, and thematically.  © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Business Intelligence (BI); Natural Language Processing (NLP); Text Relevance","Data integration; Knowledge graph; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Artificial intelligence; Business intelligence; Business-intelligence; Knowledge graphs; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Processing method; Text relevance; Virtual knowledge; Digital storage","","","","","","","Xiao G., Ding L., Cogrel B., Calvanese D., Virtual knowledge graphs: An overview of systems and use cases, Data Intelligence, 1, 3, pp. 201-223, (2019); Xiao G., Lanti D., Kontchakov R., Komla-Ebri S., Guzel-Kalayci E., Ding L., Corman J., Cogrel B., Calvanese D., Botoeva E., The virtual knowledge graph system ontop, International Semantic Web Conference, pp. 259-277, (2020); Yu S., He T., Glass J., Autokg: Constructing Virtual Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Documents for Question Answering, (2020); Kurniawan K., Ekelhart A., Kiesling E., Winkler D., Quirchmayr G., Tjoa A.M., Virtual knowledge graphs for federated log analysis, The 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, pp. 1-11, (2021); Calvanese D., Kalayci T.E., Montali M., Tinella S., Ontologybased data access for extracting event logs from legacy data: The onprom tool and methodology, International Conference on Business Information Systems, pp. 220-236, (2017); Guzel Kalayci E., Xiao G., Ryzhikov V., Kalayci T.E., Calvanese D., Ontop-Temporal: A tool for ontology-based query answering over temporal data, Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 1927-1930, (2018); Bruggemann S., Bereta K., Xiao G., Koubarakis M., Ontologybased data access for maritime security, European Semantic Web Conference, pp. 741-757, (2016); Valentin S., Arsevska E., Rabatel J., Falala S., Mercier A., Lancelot R., Roche M., Padi-web 3.0: A new framework for extracting and disseminating fine-grained information from the news for animal disease surveillance, One Health, 13, (2021); Buitinck L., Louppe G., Blondel M., Pedregosa F., Mueller A., Grisel O., Niculae V., Prettenhofer P., Gramfort A., Grobler J., Et al., Api Design for Machine Learning Software: Experiences from the Scikit-learn Project, (2013); Grootendorst M., Bertopic: Neural Topic Modeling with A Class-based Tf-idf Procedure, (2022); Honnibal M., Montani I., Van Landeghem S., Boyd A., Spacy: Industrial-strength Natural Language Processing in Python, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI)","17th International Conference on Emerging Technologies, ICET 2022","29 November 2022 through 30 November 2022","Swabi","185987","","978-166545992-1","","","English","Int.

Human Resources (HR) management and talent development make no exception, as they tend to involve more automation and growing quantities of data. Because this brings implications on workforce, career transparency, and equal opportunities, overseeing what fuels AI and analytical models, their quality standards, integrity, and correctness becomes an imperative for those aspiring to such systems. Based on an ontology transformation to B-machines, this article presents an approach to constructing a valid and error-free career agent with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In short, the agent's policy is built on a framework we called Multi State-Actor (MuStAc) using a decentralized training approach. Its purpose is to predict both relevant and valid career steps to employees, based on their profiles and company pathways (observations). Observations can comprise various data elements such as the current occupation, past experiences, performance, skills, qualifications, and so on. The policy takes in all these observations and outputs the next recommended career step, in an environment set as the combination of an HR ontology and an Event-B model, which generates action spaces with respect to formal properties. The Event-B model and formal properties are derived using OWL to B transformation.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This aversion can be caused by several factors, including individual drivers. The purpose of this paper is to better understand the extent to which individual factors influence managers’ attitudes towards the use of AI and, based on these findings, to propose solutions for increasing AI adoption. Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds on prior research, especially on the factors driving the adoption of AI in companies. In addition, data was collected by means of 16 expert interviews using a semi-structured interview guideline. Findings: The study concludes on four groups of individual factors ranked according to their importance: demographics, familiarity, psychology and personality. Moreover, the findings emphasized the importance of communication and training, explainability and transparency and participation in the process to foster the adoption of AI in decision-making. Research limitations/implications: The paper identifies four ways to foster AI integration for organizational decision-making as areas for further empirical analysis by business researchers. Practical implications: This paper offers four ways to foster AI adoption for organizational decision-making: explaining the benefits and training the more adverse categories, explaining how the algorithms work and being transparent about the shortcomings, striking a good balance between automated and human-made decisions, and involving users in the design process. Social implications: The study concludes on four groups of individual factors ranked according to their importance: demographics, familiarity, psychology and personality. Moreover, the findings emphasized the importance of communication and training, explainability and transparency and participation in the process to foster the adoption of AI in decision-making. Originality/value: This study is one of few to conduct qualitative research into the individual factors driving usage intention among managers; hence, providing more in-depth insights about managers’ attitudes towards algorithmic decision-making. This research could serve as guidance for developers developing algorithms and for managers implementing and using algorithms in organizational decision-making. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Decision-making","","","","","","","","Burton J.W., Stein M.K., Jensen T.B., A systematic review of algorithm aversion in augmented decision-making, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 33, 2, pp. 220-239, (2020); Castelo N., Bos M.W., Lehmann D.R., Task-dependent algorithm aversion, Journal of Marketing Research, 56, 5, pp. 809-825, (2019); Dietvorst B.J., Simmons J.P., Massey C., Algorithm aversion: people erroneously avoid algorithms after seeing them error, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 144, 1, pp. 114-126, (2015); Edwards J.S., Duan Y., Robins P.C., An analysis of expert systems for business decision-making at different levels and in different roles, European Journal of Information Systems, 9, 1, pp. 36-46, (2000); Enholm I.M., Papagiannidis E., Mikalef P., Krogstie J., Artificial intelligence and business value: a literature review, Information Systems Frontiers, 24, 5, (2021); Harrington R.J., Ottenbacher M.C., Decision-making tactics and contextual features: strategic, tactical and operational implications, International Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Administration, 10, 1, pp. 25-43, (2009); Kaplan A., Haenlein M., Siri, Siri, in My hand: who’s the fairest in the land?

In this context, Artificial Intelligence plays a critical role. This study aims to explore the role of Artificial Intelligence in organisational positioning within the market, influencing firms' competitiveness. In this vein, this research seeks to respond to the following research question: How does AI impact the competitive advantage of healthcare organizations?. Design/methodology/approach: To tackle the research question, an explorative analysis using the case study method to investigate an international healthcare center in Dubai was conducted. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with the head and the members of the robotic surgery team in CMC Dubai to thoroughly understand what the components of the robotic approach are and how the arrangement before the introduction of this innovative technique while shedding light on the added value and the advantages of adopting such technique on both patient safety and patient satisfaction. Additionally, archival data and online documentation (e.g. industry reports, newspaper articles and internal documents) were analyzed to obtain data triangulation. Findings: The results highlight three primary outcomes influenced by implementing AI in organizational processes: clinical, financial and technological outcomes. The study will offer interesting non-studied insights about the implementation of Artificial Intelligence tools in the healthcare sector and specifically robotic surgeries, and to which extent this will contribute and represent a competitive advantage. Results will hopefully insert a brick in the wall of the impact of AI tools on the quality and the results of surgical operations while emphasizing the benefits of integrating AI in surgical practice. Originality/value: This study offers interesting theoretical and practical implications. It opens a new perspective to understand and manage AI tools in service. This research is not without limits providing valuable insights for future research. © 2023, Talal Ali Mohamad, Anna Bastone, Fabian Bernhard and Francesco Schiavone.","Artificial intelligence: Competitive advantage; Healthcare organization; Innovation","","","","","","","","Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Alvarez S.A., Young S.L., Woolley J.L., Opportunities and institutions: a co-creation story of the king crab industry, Journal of Business Venturing, 30, 1, pp. 95-112, (2015); Appio F.P., Frattini F., Messeni Petruzzelli A.M., Neirotti P., Digital transformation and innovation management: opening up the black box, Journal of Product Innovation Management, pp. 1-6, (2018); Balogun B., Ogunnaike O.O., Healthcare Organizations in a global marketplace: a systematic Review of the literature on healthcare marketing, Journal of Marketing Management and Consumer Behavior, 1, 5, (2017); Balta M., Valsecchi R., Papadopoulos T., Bourne D.J., Digitalization and co-creation of healthcare value: a case study in Occupational Health, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 168, (2021); Bohr M., Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, (2020); Butt I., Iqbal T., Zohaib S., Healthcare marketing: a review of the literature based on citation analysis, Health Marketing Quarterly, 36, 4, pp. 271-290, (2019); Chakravorty T., Jha K., Barthwal S., Chakraborty S., Digital technologies as antecedents to process integration and dynamic capabilities in healthcare: an empirical investigation, Journal of International Technology and Information Management, 28, 4, pp. 84-111, (2020); Chung E., Domain knowledge-based human capital strategy in manufacturing AI, IEEE Engineering Management Review, (2022); Johns Hopkins medicine international, (2020); Copeland B., Artificial intelligence, (2020); Cristofaro C.L., Ventura M., Reina R., Gentile T., Measuring healthcare performance in digitalization era an empirical analysis, Do Machines Dream of Electric Workers?, pp. 137-147, (2022); Davenport T., Kalakota R., The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare, Future Healthcare Journal, 6, 2, (2019); Dubois A., Gadde L.E., Systematic combining: an abductive approach to case research, Journal of Business Research, 55, 7, pp. 553-560, (2002); Eckrich D.W., Schlesinger W., An application of the marketing concept in healthcare services planning: a case report, Journal of Management and Marketing Research, 6, 1, (2011); Farahani B., Firouzi F., Chang V., Badaroglu M., Constant N., Mankodiya K., Towards fog-driven IoT eHealth: promises and challenges of IoT in medicine and healthcare, Future Generation Computer Systems, 78, pp. 659-676, (2018); Ferreira J.J., Veiga P.M., Fernandes C.I., Kraus S., B2B marketing strategies in healthcare management: intellectual structure and research trends, Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 37, 8, pp. 1580-1593, (2022); Fiaz M., Ikram A., Ilyas A., Enterprise resource planning systems: digitisation of healthcare service quality, Administrative Sciences, 8, 3, (2018); Gioia D.A., Corley K.G., Hamilton A.L., Seeking qualitative rigor in inductive research: notes on the Gioia methodology, Organizational Research Methods, 16, 1, pp. 15-31, (2013); Hakansson Eklund J., Holmstrom I.K., Kumlin T., Kaminsky E., Skoglund K., Hoglander J., Summer Merenius M., Same same or different?

The 2022 workshop is a continuation of this reflection on AI and intelligent automation (IA) by focusing on its contribution to pharmacovigilance and the applications and tasks could be optimized to preserve and strengthen medical and pharmacological expertise in pharmacovigilance. The evolution of pharmacovigilance work is characterized by many tasks with low added value, a growing volume of pharmacovigilance reporting of suspected side effects, and a scarcity of medical staff with expertise in clinical pharmacology and pharmacovigilance and human resources to support this growing need. Together, these parameters contribute to an embolization of the pharmacovigilance system at risk of missing its primary mission: to identify and characterize a risk or even a health alert on a drug. The participants of the workshop (representatives of the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres (CRPV), the French National Agency for Safety of Medicinal Products (ANSM), patients, the pharmaceutical industry, or start-ups working in the development of AI in the field of medicine) shared their experiences, their pilot projects and their expectations on the expected potential, theoretical or proven, AI and IA. This work has made it possible to identify the needs and challenges that AI or IA represent, in the current or future modes of organization of pharmacovigilance activities. This approach led to the development of a SWOT matrix (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), a basis for reflection to identify critical points and consider four main recommendations: (1) preserve and develop business expertise in pharmacovigilance (including research and development in methods) with the integration of new technologies; (2) improve the quality of pharmacovigilance reports; (3) adapt technical and regulatory means; (4) implement a development strategy for AI and IA tools at the service of expertise. © 2022","Artificial automation; Artificial intelligence; Evaluation; Interoperability; Machine learning; Pharmacovigilance; Side effects","Article; artificial embolization; artificial intelligence; automation; clinical pharmacology; clinical research; data interoperability; drug industry; feedback system; human; medical staff; personal experience; pharmacovigilance; workshop","","","","","Association des Ateliers de Giens","The Giens Workshop costs are assumed by the Association des Ateliers de Giens that organizes the final workshop meeting.

We leverage primary data from 217 samples and examine the firm's social sustainability performance. Drawing on the paradigm of dynamic capability view, we found that a B2B firm's technology readiness has a positive relationship with information and communication technology and AI-CRM capability. Information and communication technology capability also has a positive and significant relationship with AI-CRM capability. B2B firms' relationship performance has a significant and positive relationship with social sustainability performance. A key finding of this study is that a B2B firm's information and communication technology capability mediates between technology readiness and AI-CRM capability. Additionally, industry dynamism also moderates the link between information and communication technology capability and AI-CRM capability. © 2022 The Author(s)","Artificial Intelligence; B2B; CRM-Capability; Digitalization; Firm Technology Readiness; Relationship Performance","","","","","","Emerald South Asia; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Shivam Gupta (Ph.D.) is a Professor at NEOMA Business School, France.

Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) prediction models can help to classify the likelihood of employees voluntarily departing from employment using historical employee datasets. However, output responses generated by these AI-based ML models lack transparency and interpretability, making it difficult for HR managers to understand the rationale behind the AI predictions. If managers do not understand how and why responses are generated by AI models based on the input datasets, it is unlikely to augment data-driven decision-making and bring value to the organisations. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the capability of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to intuitively explain the ET predictions generated by AI-based ML models for a given employee dataset to HR managers. From a theoretical perspective, we contribute to the International Human Resource Management literature by presenting a conceptual review of AI algorithmic transparency and then discussing its significance to sustain competitive advantage by using the principles of resource-based view theory. We also offer a transparent AI implementation framework using LIME which will provide a useful guide for HR managers to increase the explainability of the AI-based ML models, and therefore mitigate trust issues in data-driven decision-making. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AI transparency; Artificial intelligence; employee turnover; human intelligence; local interpretation; machine learning; model explainability","","","","","","Aston Business School; College College of Business and Social Science; Aston University","The research reported in this manuscript has received funding from Aston Seed Grants 2020-21 (Aston Business School, College College of Business and Social Science, Aston University) for the project, ‘Developing Artificial Intelligence Capacity, Capability and Strategy.","Addis C., Kutar M., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and UK organisations: a year of implementation of GDPR.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce operational costs, increase efficiency, and improve customer experience. Thus, it is crucial to forming project teams in an organization, in such a way that they will welcome AI in the decision-making process. The current technological revolution is demanding a rapid pace of change to companies and has increased the attention to the role of teams in fostering innovation adoption. We propose an innovative multicriteria model based on the goal programming approach for solving the optimal allocation of individuals to different groups. The model copes with human resources' cost and human-machine trust. Indeed, we propose an aggregated measure of the attitude towards AI tools to be employed to support tasks in an organization: more precisely our index is based on three dimensions: technology acceptance, technology self-efficacy, and source credibility. By incorporating this index in a team formation model, each team can be guaranteed to have less resistance to change in adopting machine-based decisions, a scenario that will characterize the years to come. The proposed index can also be integrated into more complex and comprehensive models to support business transformation. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); goal programming (GP); innovation drivers; multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM); organizational change; team formation; technology acceptance","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Human resource management; Scheduling; Artificial intelligence; Context models; Goal programming; Goal-programming; Index; Innovation driver; Multiple criteria decision making; Multiple criteria decision-making; Organizational change; Psychology; Resource management; Scheduling; Team formation; Technology acceptance; Goal programming","","","","","","","Nambisan S., Digital entrepreneurship: Toward a digital technology perspective of entrepreneurship, Entrepreneurship Theory Pract., 41, 6, pp. 1029-1055, (2010); Goncalves J.M., Ferreira F.A.F., Ferreira J.J.M., Farinha L.M.C., A multiple criteria group decision-making approach for the assessment of small and medium-sized enterprise competitiveness, Manage.

More specifically the human influencers' era? Indeed, AI-powered digital avatars called “virtual influencers” are replacing them as marketing influence partners with the biggest brands, such as Prada, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton. By this choice, they avoid associating their business with the names of influencers who could have a very bad reputation overnight. This research aims to understand the incredible popularity of certain virtual influencers among consumers as well as their limits. This article explores this emerging phenomenon using a mixed qualitative methodology combining three retail case studies in Brazil and 16 experts open-ended interviews with. The results show that: (1) not being human is advantageous to virtual influencers; (2) their story is more important than their appearance in creating engagement; (3) they contribute to improve digital marketing campaigns; and (4) they seem more authentic than human influencers. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Digital influencers; Influencer marketing; Social media; Storytelling; Virtual influencers","Brazil; Commerce; Virtual reality; Case-studies; Digital influencer; Digital marketing; Influence marketing; Marketing campaign; Qualitative methodologies; Social media; Storytelling; Virtual influencer; artificial intelligence; marketing; qualitative analysis; retailing; social media; virtual reality; Marketing","","","","","","","Abdel-Basset M., Chang V., Nabeeh N.A., An intelligent framework using disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis, Technol.

The economy has been suffering due to the strategic lockdown adopted by the local administrative bodies, and in most of the countries, it is further leading to a major wave of unemployment with millions of job and business losses affecting the hotels, travel and tourism industry widely. To attain a sustainable business in the post-pandemic situations, the industry now must think of information system approaches to convince tourists to feel safe with the most hygienic hospitality and services to be offered in any property. The key aspect of the study is to provide the impact of new-age AI-driven technology solutions that will dominate the future direction of the modernized hospitality industry promising robust health-safety measures in a hotel, and further help create sustainable business and leisure travel facilities to cope with post-epidemic scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: The study emphasizes to provide a robust technology-oriented framework based on a mixed research method that would help hotels to adopt and implement new-age AI-driven solution within the hotel premise to serve customers with at most hygiene, contactless service and thereafter, aiming for faster recovery of businesses and regaining customer trust to fuel booking intent in the post-epidemic scenario. Findings: The paper provides a technology-focused solution that would impact hotel industries' post-pandemic scenario. The study contributes to helping boost the tourism industry using information management solutions such as biosensors, robotic room services and contactless hosting. The findings show the adoption of robots/RPA solutions and Biosensors by the industry will be a disruptive paradigm shift.

Throughout this investigation, the study additionally explored the impact of several other dimensions, including information communication technology capability, firm fit, and technological readiness, as fundamental requirements for the implementation of AI-based partner relationship management. The present study also investigates the relationship between firm partner engagement and firm information processing systems for climate management of B2B firms and their impact on achieving firm performance and sustainable competitiveness. A mixed-methods approach was employed that involves in-depth interviews with senior managers from a diverse set of B2B firms, and the proposed hypothesis model was evaluated by analysing the collected B2B data of 142 responses using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The findings of the study show that information communication technology capability and technological readiness play a significant role in improving the performance of AI-based partner relationship management. Furthermore, the implementation of AI-based partner relationship management in B2B firms would help partner engagement and information processing systems for climate management, leading to sustainable firm competitiveness. The outcomes of this study offer many implications for managers and practitioners in the B2B sector and suggest potential avenues for future research. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; B2B firms; Climate change; Performance; Sustainable competitiveness; Technological readiness","","","","","","","","Akter S., Gunasekaran A., Wamba S.F., Babu M.M., Hani U., Reshaping competitive advantages with analytics capabilities in service systems, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 159, (2020); Akter S., Wamba S.F., Gunasekaran A., Dubey R., Childe S.J., How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?, International Journal of Production Economics, 182, pp. 113-131, (2016); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, (1988); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating Nonresponse bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, (1977); Bag S., Gupta S., Kumar A., Sivarajah U., An integrated artificial intelligence framework for knowledge creation and B2B marketing rational decision making for improving firm performance, Industrial Marketing Management, 92, pp. 178-189, (2021); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Businesswire, Paige and Leica Biosystems announce expanded partnership to enhance use of image management and artificial intelligence technology in global digital pathology workflows, (2023); Cainelli G., De Marchi V., Grandinetti R., Does the development of environmental innovation require different resources?

Accordingly, studies aimed at predicting stock performance are gaining popularity in both academic and business circles. This research aims to develop a knowledge graph-based model for representing stock price movements using fundamental ratios of well-known corporations in India. The paper uses data from 15 ratios taken from the top 50 companies according to market capitalization in India. The data were processed, and different algorithms were used to extract tuples of knowledge from the data. Our technique involves guiding a domain expert through the process of building a knowledge graph. The scripts of the proposed knowledge representation and data could be found here: GitHub. The work can be integrated with a deep learning model for explainable forecasting of stock price. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; fundamental analysis; knowledge representation and reasoning; stock market; symbolic AI","","","","","","","","Chakraborty I., Capital structure in an emerging stock market: The case of India, Res.

Publications relying on large-scale datasets use only proprietary, unpublished data due to the sensitive nature of such documents. Publicly available datasets are mostly small and domain-specific. The absence of a large-scale public dataset or benchmark hinders the reproducibility and cross-evaluation of published methods. The DocILE 2023 competition, hosted as a lab at the CLEF 2023 conference and as an ICDAR 2023 competition, will run the first major benchmark for the tasks of Key Information Localization and Extraction (KILE) and Line Item Recognition (LIR) from business documents. With thousands of annotated real documents from open sources, a hundred thousand of generated synthetic documents, and nearly a million unlabeled documents, the DocILE lab comes with the largest publicly available dataset for KILE and LIR.

However, firms can make substantial progress by adopting regenerative approaches grounded in circular economy principles, enabling them to effectively pursue sustainable development objectives such as responsible production and consumption (goal 12), climate action (goal 13), and the preservation of life on land (goal 15). However, there is a scarcity of research studies that offer guidance to top supply chain (SC) executives, aiming to enhance their environmental focus and enhance the SC viability through regenerative SC practices. This study employed the philosophical perspective of the natural resource-based view. Advancing the SC literature, it tested a theoretical model to investigate the relationship between the political skills and SC analytics skills of top SC executives and the environmental orientation of SCs. Additionally, it examined the direct and indirect (via regenerative SC) relationships between a firm's environmental orientation and SC viability. This study also tested the moderating role of a firm's artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics culture in these relationships. Applying a mixed-methods approach, the study derived a theoretical model to link the aforementioned constructs. Apart from a qualitative investigation, data were also collected through a questionnaire-based survey from 375 samples. The results indicated that the relationship between the political skills and SC analytics skills of top SC executives toward the environmental orientation of SCs is significant. Furthermore, they indicated that a firm's environmental orientation is positively related to a regenerative SC, which in turn enhances SC viability. The findings also provided evidence that a firm's AI-driven big data analytics culture enhances the strength of these relationships. The current study extends the knowledge base by integrating the two unique concepts of digitalization and circular economy. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","artificiaI intelligence-driven big data analytics culture; business strategy; circular economy; mixed methods; political skills; regenerative supply chain; supply chain analytics","","","","","","","","Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1977); Bag S., From resources to sustainability: A practice-based view of net zero economy implementation in small and medium business-to-business firms, Benchmarking: An International Journal, (2023); Bag S., Pretorius J.H.C., Gupta S., Dwivedi Y.K., Role of institutional pressures and resources in the adoption of big data analytics powered artificial intelligence, sustainable manufacturing practices and circular economy capabilities, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 163, (2021); Bag S., Rahman M.S., Rogers H., Srivastava G., Pretorius J.H.C., Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in the garment industry supply chain network, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 171, (2023); Bag S., Rahman M.S., Srivastava G., Chan H.L., Bryde D.J., The role of big data and predictive analytics in developing a resilient supply chain network in the south African mining industry against extreme weather events, International Journal of Production Economics, 251, (2022); Banerjee A., Mukhopadhyay S.K., Product-process connect in a regenerative innovation decision framework relating feasibility, impact and complexity, International Journal of Value Chain Management, 7, 1, pp. 1-36, (2013); Belhadi A., Kamble S.S., Zkik K., Cherrafi A., Touriki F.E., The integrated effect of big data analytics, lean six sigma and green manufacturing on the environmental performance of manufacturing companies: The case of North Africa, Journal of Cleaner Production, 252, (2020); Bentley J.R., Robinson J.L., Zanhour M., Managerial political skill and achieved supply chain integration: The mediating effects of supply chain orientation and organizational politics, Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 27, 3, pp. 451-465, (2022); Benzidia S., Makaoui N., Bentahar O., The impact of big data analytics and artificial intelligence on green supply chain process integration and hospital environmental performance, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 165, (2021); Bernardi R.A., Guptill S.T., Social desirability response bias, gender, and factors influencing organizational commitment: An international study, Journal of Business Ethics, 81, pp. 797-809, (2008); Bilal A.R., Fatima T., Disentangling the individual entrepreneurial orientation and SMEs success nexus: An action-based interplay of exploration activities and entrepreneurial alertness, Journal of Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies, 14, 6, pp. 976-1000, (2022); Cassivi L., Collaboration planning in a supply chain, Supply Chain Management: an International Journal, 11, 3, pp. 249-258, (2006); Cavanagh G.F., Moberg D.J., Velasquez M., The ethics of organizational politics, Academy of Management Review, 6, pp. 363-374, (1981); Chan R.Y., He H., Chan H.K., Wang W.Y., Environmental orientation and corporate performance: The mediation mechanism of green supply chain management and moderating effect of competitive intensity, Industrial Marketing Management, 41, 4, pp. 621-630, (2012); Chand P., Kumar A., Thakkar J., Ghosh K.K., Direct and mediation effect of supply chain complexity drivers on supply chain performance: An empirical evidence of organizational complexity theory, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 42, 6, pp. 797-825, (2022); Chen D.Q., Preston D.S., Swink M., How the use of big data analytics affects value creation in supply chain management, Journal of Management Information Systems, 32, 4, pp. 4-39, (2015); Cotta D., Klink L., Alten T., Al Madhoon B., How do supply chain managers perceive the relationship between resilience and sustainability practices?

To answer questions in intelligent transportation planning, such as which data are feasible, which methods are applicable for intelligent prediction of such data, and what are the available operations for prediction, this paper offers a new deep learning approach called bi-directional isometric-gated recurrent unit (BDIGRU). It is merged to the deep learning framework of neural networks for predictive analysis of travel time and business adoption for route planning. The proposed new method directly learns high-level features from big traffic data and reconstructs them by its own attention mechanism drawn by temporal orders to complete the learning process recursively in an end-to-end manner. After deriving the computational algorithm with stochastic gradient descent, we use the proposed method to perform predictive analysis of stochastic travel time under various traffic conditions (especially for congestions) and then determine the optimal vehicle route with the shortest travel time under future uncertainty. Based on empirical results with big traffic data, we show that the proposed BDIGRU method can (1) significantly improve the predictive accuracy of one-step 30 min ahead travel time compared to several conventional (data-driven, model-driven, hybrid, and heuristics) methods measured with several performance criteria, and (2) efficiently determine the optimal vehicle route in relation to the predictive variability under uncertainty. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","AI and machine learning; Big data; Predictive analytics; Smart transportation; Travel time","","","","","","Ministry of Education in Taiwan","This work was supported in part by the Center for Open Intelligent Connectivity from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan.

We propose an approach based on an event detection model on data stream to assist experts in such task. The final goal is to report to experts a meaningful description of the most impactful events occurring around the world, to help them in their daily decision-making. Design / Methodology / Approach: This work results from a cross-fertilization between business management, Information Technology and Computer science. This work relies on an expert analysis and advanced AI engines, including a case study on a specific raw material and a literature review to define the parameters to supervise. Results: We propose a general architecture based on IT and business synergy. We conduce a general study on the factors influencing raw materials price fluctuations, namely events influencing supply and demand of the commodity. Finally, we present a case study of the events, which historically affected phosphates prices. Limitations of the investigation: An in-depth knowledge of the domain is needed to analyze and quantify the events impact on the supply chain. Practical implications: This approach was first designed for assisting raw material purchasers but it can potentially be reproduced to assist other decision-makers. Originality / Value: We propose a new approach on how to anticipate the implications of external events on supply chain disruption and raw materials price evolution. This method is multidisciplinary, involving expert domain knowledge and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

In this conceptual paper, drawing on agenda setting theory and stakeholder theory, we challenge the current debate on the ethics of AI and aim to stimulate studies that develop research around three new challenges of AI text agents: automated mass manipulation and disinformation (i.e., fake agenda problem), massive low-quality content production (i.e., lowest denominator problem) and the creation of a growing buffer in the communication between stakeholders (i.e., the mediation problem). © 2022 The Authors.

We offer a theoretical contribution to consider AI ethics outside of high-level and top-down approaches, based on the distinction between “reality” and “world” from Luc Boltanski. To do so, we provide a new perspective on the debate on AI fairness and show that criticism of ML unfairness is “realist”, in other words, grounded in an already instituted reality based on demographic categories produced by institutions. Second, we show that the limits of “realist” fairness corrections lead to the elaboration of “radical responses” to fairness, that is, responses that radically change the format of data. Third, we show that fairness correction is shifting to a “domination regime” that absorbs criticism, and we provide some theoretical and practical avenues for further development in AI ethics. Using an ad hoc critical space stabilized by reality tests alongside the algorithm, we build a shared responsibility model which is compatible with the radical response to fairness issues. Finally, this paper shows the fundamental contribution of pragmatic sociology theories, insofar as they afford a social and political perspective on AI ethics by giving an active role to material actors such as database formats on ethical debates. In a context where data are increasingly numerous, granular, and behavioral, it is essential to renew our conception of AI ethics on algorithms in order to establish new models of responsibility for companies that take into account changes in the computing paradigm. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Business ethics; Fairness; Machine learning; Pragmatic sociology; Responsibility model","","","","","","","","Abbott A., Transcending general linear reality, Sociological Theory, 6, 2, pp. 169-186, (1988); Abbott A., Processual sociology, (2016); The description of technical objects’, Shaping Technology/Building Society., (1992); Ananny M., Crawford K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability, New Media and Society, (2018); Bartha P., Analogy and analogical reasoning, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2013 Edition), (2013); Bastani H., Bayati M., Online decision making with high-dimensional covariates, Operations Research, 68, (2020); Bellamy R.K., Dey K., Hind M., Hoffman S.C., Houde S., Kannan K., Nagar S., AI Fairness 360: An extensible toolkit for detecting, understanding, and mitigating unwanted algorithmic bias, (2018); Boltanski L., On Critique. a Sociology of Emancipation, (2011); Boltanski L., Thevenot L., Finding one’s way in social space, Social Science Information, 22, 4-5, pp. 631-680, (1983); Buolamwini J., Gebru T., Gender shades: Intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification, Proceedings of Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, FAT2018, pp. 77-91, (2018); Burrel J., How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms, Big Data and Society, 3, 1, pp. 1-12, (2016); Cai W., Gaebler J., Garg N., Goel S., Fair allocation through selective information acquisition, In Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, pp. 22-28, (2020); Cardon D., Cointet J.-P., Mazieres A., Neurons spike back.

Despite the undeniable importance of this topic, the primary research on the impact of IoT technology is inconsistent and scattered. The present study aims to review state-of-art literature on the application of IoT technology in the warehousing and logistics field and suggests a path for the future research through an in-depth analysis of studies done in this area. Sixty-four research articles were carefully selected after a thorough search of the Scopus and EBSCO databases, covering the period from January 2011 to 07th December 2021, to examine the applications of the IoT in the warehousing and logistics business. These articles were thoroughly reviewed and classified in terms of year-wise distribution, major publication outlets, types of study, and highly cited papers to understand the evolution and ongoing trends in this field. The findings reveal that majority of the studies on IoT in the warehousing and logistics domain have been conducted in developed countries. While logistics has been widely investigated, studies on the warehousing domain are limited. Also, there is an under-presentation of various theories in IoT research. The study highlights various gaps by synthesising existing literature and provides a fertile ground for conducting future research in this domain. Supply chain practitioners and researchers will find this review timely and valuable, which offers several valuable implications for them. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Industry 4.0; IoT; Logistics and Warehousing; PRISMA approach; Systematic literature review; TMC framework","Computation theory; Decision making; Industry 4.0; Supply chains; Warehouses; Cloud-computing; Decisions makings; Future research directions; Internet of things technologies; Logistic and warehousing; Logistic operations; Logistics industry; PRISMA approach; Systematic literature review; TMC framework; Internet of things","","","","","","","Affia I., Aamer A., An internet of things-based smart warehouse infrastructure: Design and application, Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, (2021); Arumsari S.S., Aamer A., Design and application of data analytics in an internet-of-things enabled warehouse, Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, (2021); Aruna A., Karthikeyan S., Singh S., Sailesh Kumar M., Smart glass based augmented reality for warehouse management, International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering, 8, 1, pp. 1399-1402, (2019); Bag S., Yadav G., Dhamija P., Kataria K.K., Key resources for industry 4.0 adoption and its effect on sustainable production and circular economy: An empirical study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 281, (2021); Balamurugan S., Ayyasamy A., Joseph K.S., Iot based supply chain traceability using enhanced naive bayes approach for scheming the food safety issues, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9, 3, pp. 1184-1192, (2020); Belur J., Tompson L., Thornton A., Simon M., Interrater Reliability in Systematic Review Methodology: Exploring Variation in Coder Decision-Making, Sociological Methods & Research, 50, 2, pp. 837-865, (2018); Bi Z., Wang G., Xu L.D., A visualization platform for internet of things in manufacturing applications, Internet Research, 26, 2, pp. 377-401, (2016); Binos T., Bruno V., Adamopoulos A., Intelligent agent based framework to augment warehouse management systems for dynamic demand environments, Australasian Journal of Information Systems, 25, pp. 1-25, (2021); Bremer A., Diffusion of the “internet of things” on the world of skilled work and resulting consequences for the man-machine interaction.

However, many organizations grapple with implementing AI solutions due to a lack of necessary infrastructure and mechanisms. In short, many companies are not adequately prepared to adopt AI. To make matters worse, the literature does not offer sufficient insights into this issue. To help address this issue, in this article, the authors explore what it means to become ‘AI-ready.’ Specifically, this study identifies the various dimensions of AI readiness through in-depth semi-structured interviews with top- and middle-level managers from 52 multinational corporations in Southeast Asia, primarily in India. This study employed a qualitative data analysis approach to construct a grounded theory model focusing on AI readiness. The methodology involved systematic examination and coding of data to identify key themes and patterns, enabling the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework. The findings suggest that AI readiness can be categorized into eight dimensions: informational, environmental, infrastructural, participants, process, customers, data, and technological readiness. This study makes a significant contribution to marketing, management, and information systems by conceptualizing the AI readiness construct and identifying its key dimensions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","AI adoption strategies; AI readiness; Artificial intelligence; Multinational corporations; Work system framework","Information management; Artificial intelligence adoption strategy; Artificial intelligence readiness; Customer values; In-depth analysis; Key dimensions; Multi-national corporations; Semi structured interviews; System framework; Work system; Work system framework; Artificial intelligence","","","","","University of Western Australia, UWA","This work was supported by the University of Western Australia .","Agerfalk P.J., Artificial intelligence as digital agency, Eur.

The generation that uses this tool most (Burns-Stanning, 2020) is also the most demanding and aware of climate change issues (Knight, 2016), even though its practices contribute to the current degradation. This hiatus illustrates how difficult it is to reconcile individual and collective goals. We propose shifting the question from the end-user to the service provider by detecting sobriety pits in data use and access to perpetuate or avoid disrupting end-user practices. Sobriety (frugality) is a critical variable in energy transition scenarios (Balzani, 2019) and one of the ecological transition's pillars. Social media and AI are particularly tense on these issues (Stein, 2020). Current solutions often pit energy efficiency against performance (Ikhlasse, Benjamin, Vincent & Hicham, 2021). Given the industry's promises of information access, automation, intelligent decision-making, human error avoidance, and more, this is unacceptable. Thus, we propose an operational framework to pose a model of sobriety for data access, consumption, and use (such as in social media or AI agents training) that does not impair performance or accuracy. © the authors, 2023.

Models, for example, assist our decisions on which hotel to book or set the optimal price for a flight ticket based on real-time demand, and recommendation apps advise us where to eat or which sights are worth seeing. However, not all decisions taken by automated systems are easily understandable by human beings. How can one make sure that the model does not encompass unwanted bias or discriminate clients? How can one explain to the CEO that the price should be less than what the concurrence proposes? Fortunately, ML models that are explainable do indeed exist, and there is also active research on how to make unexplainable models interpretable. The most popular methods involve Lime and Shapley values, allowing researchers to identify the importance of the input variables and, in turn, to add an interpretation to the model prediction. In this regard, this chapter will describe how to use interpretability tools with ML models and will also provide intuition on the usefulness and limitations of these tools. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); Explaining models; Interpretation of ML models; LIME; Shapley values","","","","","","","","Aamodt A., Plaza E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches, AI Commun, 7, 1, pp. 39-59, (1994); Adadi A., Berrada M., Peeking inside the black-box: A survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); Adler P., Falk C., Friedler S.A., Rybeck G., Scheidegger C., Smith B., Venkatasubramanian S., Auditing Black-Box Models for Indirect Influenc, (2016); Adler P., Falk C., Friedler S.A., Rybeck G., Scheidegger C., Smith B., Venkatasubramanian S., Github-Algofairness/Blackboxauditing: Research Code for Auditing and Exploring Black Box Machine-Learning Models, (2016); Antonio N., de Almeida A., Nunes L., Hotel booking demand datasets, Data in Brief, 22, pp. 41-49, (2019); Arras L., Montavon G., Muller K.R., Samek W., Explaining recurrent neural network predictions in sentiment analysis, Proceedings of the 8Th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, pp. 159-168, (2017); Barocas S., Selbst A.D., Big data’s disparate impact, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2018); Bastani O., Kim C., Bastani H., Interpretability via model extraction, Arxiv, Abs/1706, (2017); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Dandl S., Molnar C., Binder M., Bischl B., Multi-objective counterfactual explanations, Parallel Problem Solving from Nature--Ppsn XVI, pp. 448-469, (2020); Deb K., Pratap A., Agarwal S., Meyarivan T., A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Doshi-Velez F., Kim B., Towards a Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning, (2017); Feldman M., Friedler S., Moeller J., Scheidegger C., Venkatasubramanian S., Certifying and Removing Disparate Impact, (2015); Fisher A., Rudin C., Dominici F., All models are wrong, But Many are Useful: Learning a variable’s Importance by Studying an Entire Class of Prediction Models Simultaneously, (2019); Ghorbani A., Abid A., Zou J., Interpretation of neural networks is fragile, Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 33, 1, pp. 3681-3688, (2019); Gilmer J., Adams R.P., Goodfellow I.J., Andersen D.G., Dahl G.E., Motivating the rules of the game for adversarial example research.

A significantly underestimated source is the Sun, even when providing 1 percent of its total radiated energy to the Earth, powers a large fraction of the energy needs of nations. Several nations have spearheaded efforts towards this over the years and established solar panel infrastructures, but still needs expansion and motivation to progress. Since the advent of space technology with the Space Race and culminating into the rise of risk-tolerant nanosatellite constellations to replace monolithic large satellites with capability to perform a plethora of operations with diverse applications, ranging from Earth Observation and Navigation to new applications such as space-based Power beaming. A strategic innovative cost-effective solution to execute the COP26 and Glasgow Summit Pact outcomes is the establishment of a network of COTS small satellites using AI, active thermal control, LASER and MASER to beam Solar Power harvested from space, to direct the energy to solar panels at night, thereby utilizing existing infrastructures to generate more renewable energy and decrease the carbon footprint of all participating nations significantly for remote power reception facilities located at regions with minimal access to ground-based electricity resources. This work utilizes a previously designed and validated small satellite configuration, has designed and validated the multi-altitude multi-inclination LEO Sun-synchronous Polar orbits and flower constellation for 5 year operation using GMAT and Taitus for optimum beaming with least distance, maximum hover time, maximum coverage area, minimized drag for maximum mission life, contact opportunities and in conjunction an assessment of energy economics of all nations and simulations have revealed a significant increase of power production with the passes and eclipse duration. Generated data provided projections of energy production, costings, financial projections, Project Gantt charts and business model for implementation, proving commercial viability with high ROI for low-cost to participating nations. The same constellation may also be upgraded for future projects for internet service provision to these rural and remote areas amongst the rest, revolutionizing space operations and exploration in terms of what mankind has imagined and defined it to be, advancing the vision of every global citizen with passion for the space domain, to be part of a spacefaring utopia unlimited by distance and time. © 2022 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

To bridge these gaps, we integrate resource orchestration and knowledge-based view theoretical perspectives to develop a novel structural model examining antecedents to SCR and AI adoption, considering AI adoption as a pivot for facilitating SCR. The structural equation modelling technique was employed on the data collected from 280 Vietnamese manufacturing SMEs’ operations managers. Our results demonstrate that leadership will drive AI adoption by creating a data-driven, digital and conducive culture, and strengthening employee skills and competencies. Furthermore, AI adoption positively influences CE practices, SC agility and risk management, which will help to achieve SCR. For managers, the importance of internal organisational employee-centric mechanisms to create value from AI adoption without impeding business value is highlighted. We reveal the enablers that will help in transforming SMEs to become resilient by deriving appropriate responses to unprecedented disruptions through data-driven decision-making leveraging AI adoption. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agility;

Drawing upon the insights gained from the literature review, the study employs structural equation modeling (partial least squares structural equation modeling [PLS-SEM]) as the methodology to examine the relationships between AIDBMI, technological enablers, strategic enablers, and the attainment of carbon neutrality. The sample size consists of 326 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States of America. The findings of this study affirm the significant positive relationships between AIDBMI and both technological and strategic enablers for CNB. The utilization of AI technologies proves to be instrumental in fostering the development and implementation of innovative business models that integrate sustainability practices and address environmental challenges. By leveraging AIDBMI, SMEs can harness technological advancements to adopt energy-efficient processes, embrace renewable energy solutions, and implement effective carbon reduction strategies. Moreover, the study highlights the critical role of strategic enablers in driving the transition towards carbon neutrality. The alignment of sustainability goals with organizational strategies, stakeholder collaboration, and employee engagement emerge as pivotal factors in enabling SMEs to effectively utilize AIDBMI and leverage technological advancements to achieve carbon neutrality. The implications of this study contribute to the existing literature by highlighting the importance of technological and strategic enablers in creating CNB. By integrating AIDBMI, organizations can drive sustainable transformations, optimize their operations, and align their resource management with sustainable practices. These insights provide valuable guidance for SMEs, policymakers, and researchers seeking to foster sustainable practices, promote carbon neutrality, and contribute to the advancement of a low-carbon economy. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","AI-driven business model innovation; green innovation capability; green technology innovation; strategic architecture & carbon neutral businesses; strategic intent","","","","","","","","Abbas A., Ekowati D., Suhariadi F., Anwar A., Fenitra R.M., Technology acceptance and COVID-19: A perspective for emerging opportunities from crisis, Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, pp. 1-13, (2023); Abbas J., Khan S.M., Green knowledge management and organizational green culture: An interaction for organizational green innovation and green performance, Journal of Knowledge Management, 27, pp. 1852-1870, (2022); Aghajari N., Amat Senin A., Strategic orientation and dual innovative operation strategies: Implications for performance of manufacturing SMEs, Asia-Pacific Journal of Business Administration, 6, 2, pp. 127-147, (2014); Ahmad M., Zhu X., Wu Y., The criticality of international tourism and technological innovation for carbon neutrality across regional development levels, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 182, (2022); Alsaffar M.A., Ayodele B.V., Mustapa S.I., Scavenging carbon deposition on alumina supported cobalt catalyst during renewable hydrogen-rich syngas production by methane dry reforming using artificial intelligence modeling technique, Journal of Cleaner Production, 247, (2020); Alsakka F., Haddad A., Ezzedine F., Salami G., Dabaghi M., Hamzeh F., Generative design for more economical and environmentally sustainable reinforced concrete structures, Journal of Cleaner Production, 387, (2023); April K.A., Guidelines for developing a k-strategy, Journal of Knowledge Management, 6, 5, pp. 445-456, (2002); Arun T.M., Kaur P., Bresciani S., Dhir A., What drives the adoption and consumption of green hotel products and services?

Many post hoc methods have been proposed to explain the predictions of a single machine learning model. However, business processes and decision systems are rarely centered around a unique model. These systems combine multiple models that produce key predictions, and then apply rules to generate the final decision. To explain such decisions, we propose the Semi-Model-Agnostic Contextual Explainer (SMACE), a new interpretability method that combines a geometric approach for decision rules with existing interpretability methods for machine learning models to generate an intuitive feature ranking tailored to the end user. We show that established model-agnostic approaches produce poor results on tabular data in this setting, in particular giving the same importance to several features, whereas SMACE can rank them in a meaningful way. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Composite AI; Decision-making; Interpretability","Machine learning; Business decisions; Business Process; Composite AI; Decision systems; Decisions makings; Interpretability; Machine learning models; Pressung; Process system; Single- machines; Decision making","","","","","3IA Côte d’Azur, (ANR-19-P3IA-0002); EU Horizon 2020 project AI4Media, (951911); NIM-ML, (ANR-21-CE23-0005-01)","Acknowledgments.

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts. © 2023 The Authors","ChatGPT; Conversational agent; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Large language models","Commerce; Ethical technology; Information management; ChatGPT; Conversational agents; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; In-field; Intelligent tools; Language model; Large language model; Marketing information system; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Marketing","","","","","","","Abdulquadri A., Mogaji E., Kieu T., Nguyen P., Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Adams M., (2023); Adams T., Daniel Kahneman: ‘Clearly AI is going to win.

However, most of the modern AI techniques (e.g., Machine Learning – ML) have a black box nature, which hinder their adoption by practitioners in many application fields. This issue raises a recent emergence of a new research area in AI called Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), aiming at providing AI-based decision-making processes and outcomes to be easily understood, interpreted, and justified by humans. Since 2018, there has been an exponential growth of research studies on XAI, which has justified some review studies. However, these reviews currently focus on proposing taxonomies of XAI methods. Yet, XAI is by nature a highly applicative research field, and beyond XAI methods, it is also very important to investigate how XAI is concretely used in industries, and consequently derive the best practices to follow for better implementations and adoptions. There is a lack of studies on this latter point. To fill this research gap, we first propose a holistic review of business applications of XAI, by following the Theory, Context, Characteristics, and Methodology (TCCM) protocol. Based on the findings of this review, we secondly propose a methodological and theoretical framework in six steps that can be followed by all practitioners or stakeholders for improving the implementation and adoption of XAI in their business applications. We particularly highlight the need to rely on domain field and analytical theories to explain the whole analytical process, from the relevance of the business question to the robustness checking and the validation of explanations provided by XAI methods. Finally, we propose seven important future research avenues. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Business applications; Deep learning; Explainable artificial intelligence; Framework; Interpretable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; Management; TCCM; XAI","Deep learning; Learning systems; Business applications; Deep learning; Explainable artificial intelligence; Framework; Interpretable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; Machine-learning; Methodological frameworks; Theory, context, characteristic, and methodology; XAI; Decision making","","","","","","","Adadi A., Berrada M., Peeking inside the black-box: a survey on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); Alvarez Melis D., Jaakkola T., Towards robust interpretability with self-explaining neural networks, Adv.

A vessel not knowing its position while navigating in the Arctic may find itself in a critical situation. In the framework of the 2nd CASSINI Hackathon aimed to promote ideas based on safe passage in the Arctic, the authors developed a product called North Star. The aim of North Star is using Earth Observation data provided by Galileo and Copernicus services to improve navigation in the Arctic. It consists of an on-board neural engine, the AI Pilot, which searches for and identifies a safe route for the user. The neural engine can be trained on the Copernicus data from the Sentinel constellation, which includes information such as ice thickness, iceberg distribution, wind speed direction, and wave height for a specific passage. In the event of a satellite signal loss, the AI Pilot reuses the information received from Galileo up to that point and integrates them with the vessel's own maritime sensors to maintain the viability of the projected route. The idea behind the AI Pilot is that when a vessel is within communication range with other North Star vessels, they form an ad-hoc mesh network of data collectors with edge computing capabilities. The creation of a mesh network can provide augmented data to the entire GNSS ecosystem. While shipping transportation of oil and gas across the Arctic passages undergoes more strict regulations, private tourism and charter yacht operators in the Arctic are an emerging market due to the relatively unsafe travel conditions. North Star can have a beneficial impact on the tourist sector in the first place, extending afterwards to support Search and Rescue operations, as well as contributing to the protection of the environment and the Arctic fauna. This research presents the concept of operations of North Star, as well as its high-level description from the technical perspective. The potential of this business case is further investigated, to include a roadmap of services offered until the return of investment, potential customers, and current competitors.

But ATPs are very complex, because of the reality of the adoption of a holistic concept, which can be considered as a polymathic concept. A polymathic concept promotes the development of an interdisciplinary core and project-based learning for future transformation project's managers and architects. This chapter proposes the applied holistic and poly-mathematical model (AHMM) for ATPs (AHMM4ATP), which is a variant of the author's AHMM and research works. The AHMM4ATP-based RTBLP combines various educational fields that can include business engineering/transformation, enterprise (re)organization, societal changes, business/finance, AI, mathematics, and geopolitical contexts. This research chapter is another topic in the author's research and development project (RDP). The RDP is the continuation of previous works and findings that are used to prove RTBLP's feasibility and to offer a polymathics' curriculum for the secondary school cycle. © 2024, IGI Global.

This document discusses the current AI scientific evidence in thoracic imaging, its potential clinical utility, implementation and costs, training requirements and validation, its’ effect on the training of new radiologists, post-implementation issues, and medico-legal and ethical issues. All these issues have to be addressed and overcome, for AI to become implemented clinically in thoracic radiology. Key Points: • Assessing the datasets used for training and validation of the AI system is essential. • A departmental strategy and business plan which includes continuing quality assurance of AI system and a sustainable financial plan is important for successful implementation. • Awareness of the negative effect on training of new radiologists is vital. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence;

Openness promotes collaboration among various vendors to provide diverse components (hardware, software, or both) for the RAN ecosystem, while intelligence handles complex network activities using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although O-RAN design addresses many issues in traditional RANs, such as vendor lock-in, lack of flexibility, and limited innovation, it raises several management and security concerns related to collaboration, access management, privacy, trust, and availability. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) offer a viable method of establishing trust among entities, managing resources efficiently, and automating complex network tasks. Several DLT properties, such as distributed architecture, high automation through smart contracts, immutability, and transparency, could position DLT-based ideas as game changers in a multi-vendor O-RAN ecosystem. Furthermore, this technology has the potential to introduce new business models and establish secure and trusted micro-payments among vendors and network participants. In this paper, we first present a taxonomy for discussing existing O-RAN challenges. Based on the taxonomy, we then examine the possibility of incorporating DLT-based solutions in O-RAN architecture to address these challenges.  © 2023 IEEE.","Blockchain; DLT; Intelligence; Multi-vendor; O-RAN; Openness; Smart contract","Blockchain; Complex networks; Distributed ledger; Ecosystems; Network function virtualization; Network security; Radio access networks; Taxonomies; Block-chain; Distributed ledg technology; Hardware/software; Intelligence; Multi-vendor; Open radio access network; Openness; Radio access networks; Technology-based; Tightly-coupled; Smart contract","","","","","","","O-RAN Towards An Open and Smart RAN, (2018); Polese M., Bonati L., Doro S., Basagni S., Melodia T., Understanding o-ran: Architecture, interfaces, algorithms, security, and research challenges, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, (2023); Aryal N., Bertin E., Crespi N., Open radio access network challenges for next generation mobile network, 2023 26th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks and Workshops (ICIN) IEEE, pp. 90-94, (2023); Luka M.K., Okereke O.U., Omizegba E.E., Anene E.C., Blockchains for Spectrum Management in Wireless Networks: A Survey, (2021); Giupponi L., Wilhelmi F., Blockchain-enabled network sharing for o-ran in 5g and beyond, IEEE Network, (2022); Liyanage M., Braeken A., Shahabuddin S., Ranaweera P., Open ran security: Challenges and opportunities, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 214, (2023); Singh S.K., Singh R., Kumbhani B., The evolution of radio access network towards open-ran: Challenges and opportunities, 2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW).

Indeed, recent reports and academic publications show that we are clearly on the path toward pervasive AI in both business and society. Organizations must adopt AI to maintain a competitive advantage and explore opportunities for unprecedented innovation. This book focuses on understanding the wide range of opportunities as well as the spectrum of challenges AI brings in different business contexts and society at large. The book highlights novel and high-quality research in data science and business analytics and examines the current and future impact of AI in business and society. The authors bridge the gap between business and technical perspectives and demonstrate the potential (and actual) impact on society. Embracing applied, qualitative, and quantitative research as well as field experiments and data analysis, the book covers a broad range of topics including but not limited to human-centered AI, product and process innovation, corporate governance, AI and ethics, organizational performance, and entrepreneurship. This comprehensive book will be a valuable resource for researchers, academics, and postgraduate students across AI, technology and innovation management, and a wide range of business disciplines. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Francesco Paolo Appio, Davide La Torre, Francesca Lazzeri, Hatem Masri, Francesco Schiavone; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-100091262-3; 978-103230341-3","","","English","Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Bus. and Society: Opportunities and Challenges","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169389817"

The business applications require knowledge of the key concepts and their organization to perform the classification of news articles. To ensure and maintain reliable information classification quality, it is crucial to keep the same definitions and organization of these concepts. This indicates the major significance of BI taxonomies in organizations. However, their development in business information systems follows an ad hoc process in most cases. Compared to many other domains, e.g. environmental and life sciences research, no mature and updated BI taxonomies are available in the literature. Existing studies cover BI taxonomies, but these are excessively generic and domain-specific. As a result, the BI domain suffers from many immature, incorrect, and incomplete notions of concepts. New BI-related concepts emerge rapidly, making it essential to include them in existing taxonomies during the enrichment process. The contribution of our research is the exploration of the possibilities of taxonomy enrichment using existing datasets. The expansion of the existing business taxonomy using multifaceted data sources to capture new concepts comprising 1) lexical datasets, 2) pre-trained word embeddings, 3) linked open data vocabulary, and 4) corpus-based relevant thematic extraction of features from news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The highest semantic enrichment rate of a taxonomy got on a combination of these 4 methods. Eventually, enriched business taxonomy will contribute to the improved classification of news articles. © 2022 The Authors.

However, our knowledge of factor influencing AI adoption by organization is still limited. Responding to calls for more empirical research on AI adoption at firm-level, we used data collected in 2019 from a European-Wide survey of a representative sample of 9272 firms on the adoption or non-adoption of 10 different types of AI technologies. We investigated predictors of adoption, intention to adopt and non-adoption of AI using Multivariate logistic regression. Consistent with previous research, our results confirm that firm size and perceived obstacles matter for AI adoption. © 2022 IEEE.","adoption; artificial intelligence; logistic regression; predictors; survey","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Adoption; Adoption intention; Artificial intelligence technologies; Economic growths; Empirical research; Large scale surveys; Logistics regressions; Policy makers; Predictor; Representative sample; Surveys","","","","","","","Crevier D., AI: The Tumultuous History of the Search for Artificial Intelligence, (1993); Kaul V., Enslin S., Gross S.A., History of artificial intelligence in medicine, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 92, 4, pp. 807-812, (2020); Schwendicke F A., Samek W., Krois J., Artificial intelligence in dentistry: Chances and challenges, Journal of Dental Research, 99, 7, pp. 769-774, (2020); Patricio D.I., Rieder R., Computer vision and artificial intelligence in precision agriculture for grain crops: A systematic review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 153, pp. 69-81, (2018); Giudici P., Fintech risk management: A research challenge for artificial intelligence in finance, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, Specialty Grand Challenge, 1, (2018); Klumpp M., Automation and artificial intelligence in business logistics systems: Human reactions and collaboration requirements, International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications, 21, 3, pp. 224-242, (2018); Calo R., Artificial intelligence policy: A primer and roadmap, UCDL Rev., 51, (2017); Are Social W., Digital 2021: The latest insights into how people around the world use the internet, social media, mobile devices, and ecommerce global overview report, We Are Social, (2021); Jovanovic B., Rousseau P.L., General purpose technologies, National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series, (2005); Brynjolfsson E., McAfee A., The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in A Time of Brilliant Technologies, (2014); Iansiti M., Lakhani K., The digital business divide analyzing the operating impact of digital transformation, Analyzing the Operating Impact of Digital Transformation.

The first is the resource-forest constraint, where we assume that a subset R⊆V of the vertices are resource vertices. The constraint specifies that each tree in the forest must contain at least one resource vertex. This is the natural undirected counterpart of the tree constraint (Beldiceanu et al., CP-AI-OR'05, Springer, Berlin, 2005), which partitions a directed graph into a forest of directed trees where only certain vertices can be tree roots. We describe a hybrid-consistency algorithm that runs in O(m+n)time for the resource-forest constraint, a sharp improvement over the O(mn) bound that is known for the directed case. The second constraint is proper-forest. In this variant, we do not have the requirement that each tree contains a resource, but the forest must contain only proper trees, i.e., trees that have at least two vertices each. We develop a hybrid-consistency algorithm for this case whose running time is O(mn)in the worst case, and O(m√n) in many (typical) cases. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Constraint programming; Global constraints; Graph partitioning","","","","","","","","Beldiceanu N., Katriel I., Lorca X., Undirected forest constrainsts, CP-AI-OR'06, 3990, (2006); Beldiceanu N., Flener P., Lorca X., The tree constraint, CP-AI-OR'05, 3524, pp. 64-78, (2005); Lauriere J.-L., A language and a program for stating and solving combinatorial problems, Artificial Intelligence, 10, pp. 29-127, (1978); Beldiceanu N., Contejean E., Introducing global constraint in CHIP, Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 20, 12, pp. 97-123, (1994); Sellmann M., Cost-based filtering for shortest path constraints, CP 2003, 2833, pp. 694-708, (2003); Dincbas M., van Hentenryck P., Simonis H., Aggoun A., Graf T., Berthier F., The constraint logic programming language CHIP, Int.

The authors develop theoretical speculations to investigate better the role of artificial intelligence (AI) as an innovative tool to improve buyer-supplier relationships, creating better performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a theoretical investigation aiming at exploring the role of AI-based solutions for managing buyer-supplier relationships. The conceptual approach allows us to identify some research streams (e.g. co-working collaborations in supply chain management) by proposing a matrix that helps clarify the analysis's directions. Findings: The results show the importance of AI that can help the operator in accessing supplier information, including current prices, available stocks, and delivery status, thereby reducing the risk of information asymmetry. AI is intended not only as a technology tool but also as an innovative solution to promote business relationships and support vertical alliances through the value chain between buyer and supplier. Originality/value: This paper can help healthcare actors examine the choices behind their operational strategies by providing transparency of the activities and availability of information in real-time. Finally, our study reflects the future directions to enhance the cooperation and innovation adoption among healthcare operators. © 2022, Chiara Cannavale, Anna Esempio Tammaro, Daniele Leone and Francesco Schiavone.","Artificial intelligence;

Due to constantly evolving social, environmental, and technological scenarios, the managers of these firms must increasingly focus on incorporating new tools such as AI into SME operations in order to enjoy their benefits. However, the subjectivity and complexity of this adaptation process makes integrated analyses of key factors challenging. The present study sought to develop a multi-criteria decision-support system that applies cognitive mapping and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique in a neutrosophic context. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of previous studies and models by structuring the decision problem and identifying and understanding which factors should be central to adaptation initiative analyses. A panel of experts in AI were recruited to facilitate the construction of an analysis system that takes into account indeterminacy in decision-making processes. The results were validated by both the panel members and project managers at COTEC Portugal—a leading think-and-action network that seeks to advance technology diffusion and business innovation cooperation. The proposed system’s practical implications and benefits are also analyzed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive mapping; Decision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL); Neutrosophic logic; Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00315/2020, UIDB/04630/2020)","This work was partially funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Grants UIDB/00315/2020 and UIDB/04630/2020).

In this respect, the maintenance is among the most critical activities concerned by the industrial data analytics in the contexts of industry 4.0. We believe that the maintenance activities can be managed by the predictive processes dwelling on ML methods with the help of meta-learning based data analytics solutions. The challenge is then to facilitate the industry 4.0 actors, who are supposedly not AI specialists, with the application of machine learning. The automated machine learning seems to be the area dealing with this challenge. In this paper, we first show the problematic of assisting industry 4.0 actors to implement ML algorithms in the context of predictive maintenance. We then present a novel AutoML based framework. It aims to enable industry 4.0 actors and researchers, who presumably have limited competencies in machine learning, to generate ML-based data analytics solutions and their deployment in the manufacturing workflows. The framework implements primarily the approaches based on the meta-learning for this purpose. In the context of Industry 4.0 such approaches lead to the implementation of the smart factory concepts. It makes the factory processes more proactive on the basis of predictive knowledge extracted from the various manufacturing devices, sensors, and business processes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AutoML; Data analytics; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Meta-learning","","","","","","Calais France; Université du Littoral Côte d'Opale, ULCO; Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique et Technique, CNRST","Funding text 1: This work has been supported, in part, by Hestim, CNRST Morocco, and University of the Littoral Cote d’Opale, Calais France.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgements.

To have a sustainable vision of their business, firms need to have a suitable decision-making process at each stage, including minute details. Our study reviews and investigates the existing research in the field of decision support systems (DSSs) and how artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have been integrated into OR. The findings of our review show how AI has contributed to decision making in the operations research field. This review presents synergies, differences, and overlaps in AI, DSSs, and OR. Furthermore, a clarification of the literature based on the approaches adopted to develop the DSS is presented along with the underlying theories. The classification has been primarily divided into two categories, i.e. theory building and application-based approaches, along with taxonomies based on the AI, DSS, and OR areas. In this review, past studies were calibrated according to prognostic capability, exploitation of large data sets, number of factors considered, development of learning capability, and validation in the decision-making framework. This paper presents gaps and future research opportunities concerning prediction and learning, decision making and optimization in view of intelligent decision making in today’s era of uncertainty. The theoretical and managerial implications are set forth in the discussion section justifying the research questions. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Operations research; Systematic literature review","","","","","","Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, IIMC","This study was supported by the Category II research grant received from the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta with work order number 3557/RP:ATBOCOMSUDM.

Postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients without previous adjuvant AI treatment received exemestane 25 mg/days plus either celecoxib 400 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression- free survival (PFS). This trial was prematurely terminated (N = 157 of 342 planned) after cardiovascular toxicity was reported in other celecoxib trials. Although no PFS difference was observed between the two arms (9.8 months for both, P = 0.72), a trend favoring celecoxib was observed in 60 tamoxifen-resistant patients (9.6 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.14) and in 126 patients treated ≥3 months before study termination (12.2 vs. 9.8 months; P = 0.09). No severe adverse events were reported. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors seemingly contribute to reverse endocrine resistance in breast cancer patients, although further study is necessary to allow development of a new therapeutic strategy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.","Aromatase; Breast cancer; Celecoxib; Clinical trial; Cyclooxygenase-2; Exemestane","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Androstadienes; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Aromatase Inhibitors; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent; Placebos; Postmenopause; Prognosis; Pyrazoles; Soft Tissue Neoplasms; Sulfonamides; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; celecoxib; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; exemestane; placebo; progesterone receptor; tamoxifen; androstane derivative; aromatase inhibitor; celecoxib; exemestane; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pyrazole derivative; sulfonamide; adult; aged; alopecia; anorexia; arthralgia; article; asthenia; bone metastasis; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer resistance; cancer survival; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug eruption; drug hypersensitivity; drug withdrawal; dysesthesia; dyspnea; edema; female; gastrointestinal symptom; heart arrhythmia; hepatic cytolysis; human; insomnia; liver disease; liver metastasis; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; metastasis; mucosa inflammation; multicenter study; pain; phase 3 clinical trial; pleura metastasis; postmenopause; priority journal; progression free survival; purpura; randomized controlled trial; side effect; soft tissue metastasis; tremor; visual disorder; weight gain; weight reduction; adjuvant chemotherapy; breast tumor; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug combination; drug effect; liver tumor; lung tumor; lymph node; metastasis; middle aged; neoplasm; pathology; postmenopause; prognosis; soft tissue tumor; survival rate; treatment outcome","","celecoxib, 169590-42-5; epidermal growth factor receptor 2, 137632-09-8; exemestane, 107868-30-4; tamoxifen, 10540-29-1; Androstadienes, ; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal, ; Aromatase Inhibitors, ; Placebos, ; Pyrazoles, ; Sulfonamides, ; celecoxib, 169590-42-5; exemestane, 107868-30-4","","","Pfizer","Acknowledgments This study was supported by a grant from Pfizer Inc.

Online news articles are one of the main data sources that present up-to-date business news offered by various companies in the market. Topic modeling, i.e. a key player in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, helps businesses to drive value from news articles. Also, it supports the extraction of business insights from news articles to facilitate the identification of trends (topics) in the market and their evolution over time. These insights can help businesses not only automate routine tasks but also in building new marketing policies, decision-making, and customer support. It is also important to find the linked semantic information (i.e. key persons, organizations, or regions called named entities) involved in generating these topics for the identification of news sources. This paper presents the application of a hybrid approach based on dynamic topic modeling and Named-Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting business trends along with the related entities. To show the functionality of the proposed approach, the news articles collected from the websites that published the content related to company interests were from 2017 to 2021 inclusive. The proposed approach can serve as the foundation for future exploratory trend analysis to study the evolution of information not only in the business domain but also applicable in other domains.

With the prodigious technological leap made in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years, disruptive innovations have affected many business sectors, with economic, social and ethical consequences. But what do people really want about the application of artificial intelligence technologies in the law system? This article presents a general methodological approach to take into account the ethical aspect of the introduction of a new technology in a given domain. We apply this methodology in the specific case of the introduction of AI technologies in the law system. As a multidisciplinary working group interested in this application in the case of France, we have organized a series of workshops to discuss this topic and highlight the respective values and interests of each stakeholder.

Teterboro Airport, Box 2000, South Hackensack, 07606, NJ, United States","The supply chain performance depends on accurate demand forecasting. This becomes more critical when it comes to non-contract spare parts service supply chains. This is because of the fact that customers are not obliged to place an order for the required spare parts to its Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) due to the availability of multiple suppliers. The business aircraft spare parts supply chains are the ones most affected by this phenomenon because their travel pattern and usage is totally unpredictable in comparison with passenger airline carriers. These highly uncertain and unpredictable demands and subsequent inaccurate forecasts have severe financial consequences. It is also computationally expensive to predict demand forecast for each part due to huge number of spare parts in business aircraft's supply chain. Hence, in this paper the objective is to investigate forecasting methods, their variants and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, developed for irregular demands, to propose best method variant that is capable of accurately forecasting not only uncertain but unpredictable demand e.g. business aircraft's spare parts supply chain. We retained Boot Strapping (BS) method as the most suitable base method for uncertain and unpredictable demand forecasting. This is because of its inherent ability to reduce error due to resampling with replacement. The point and interval (existing), and sliding window (proposed) BS methods are implemented in Matlab and results of demand forecasts are compared with the forecasts generated from benchmarked existing forecasting methods as: Croston, Croston variants (SBJ, SNB, TSB), moving average (MA), single exponential smoothening (SES) and Commercial (proprietary black box) methods. The data used in this study is collected from Dassault Aviation. The results demonstrate that proposed sliding windows BS variant with ‘Mean’ function outperformed 75% of the spare parts with significant financial gains in terms of inventory holding and shortage costs. © 2017","Boot Strapping; Business Aircraft's industry; Demand forecasting; Spare parts supply chains","Aircraft manufacture; Artificial intelligence; Civil aviation; Decoding; Forecasting; Strapping; Supply chains; Tourism industry; Boot-strapping; Business aircraft; Demand forecasting; Forecasting methods; Original equipment manufacturers; Spare parts service; Spare parts supply; Supply chain performance; Aircraft parts and equipment","","","","","","","Bacchetti A., Saccani N., Spare parts classification and demand forecasting for stock control: Investigating the gap between research and practice, Omega, 40, 6, pp. 722-737, (2012); Bartezzaghi E., Verganti R., Zotteri G., A simulation framework for forecasting uncertain lumpy demand, International Journal of Production Economics, 59, 1, pp. 499-510, (1999); Boylan J.E., Syntetos A.A., (2009); Boylan J.E., Syntetos A.A., Karakostas G.C., Classification for forecasting and stock control: a case study, Journal of the operational research society, 59, 4, pp. 473-481, (2008); Chiou H.K., Tzeng G.H., Cheng C.K., Prediction G., GM (1, 1) Model for Forecasting Demand of Planned Spare Parts in Navy of Taiwan, MCDM, pp. 6-11, (2004); Chopra S., Meindl P., (2007); Christopher M., (2000); Efron B.T., (1993); Efron B., Tibshirani R.J., An introduction to the bootstrap, (1994); Ghobbar A.A., Friend C.H., Evaluation of forecasting methods for intermittent parts demand in the ÿeld of aviation: a predictive model, 30, pp. 2097-2114, (2003); Gutierrez R.S., Solis A.O., Mukhopadhyay S., Lumpy demand forecasting using neural networks, International Journal of Production Economics, 111, 2, pp. 409-420, (2008); Kalchschmidt M., Zotteri G., Verganti R., Inventory management in a multi-echelon spare parts supply chain, International journal of production economics, 81, pp. 397-413, (2003); Nikolaos K., 156; Naess A., Clausen P.H., Combination of the peaks-over-threshold and bootstrapping methods for extreme value prediction, Structural Safety, 23, 4, pp. 315-330, (2001); Regattieri A., Gamberi M., Gamberini R., Manzini R., Managing lumpy demand for aircraft spare parts, Journal of Air Transport Management, 11, 6, pp. 426-431, (2005); Romeijnders W., Teunter R., van Jaarsveld W., A two-step method for forecasting spare parts demand using information on component repairs, European Journal of Operational Research, 220, 2, pp. 386-393, (2012); Sahay B.S., Ranjan J., Real time business intelligence in supply chain analytics, Information Management & Computer Security, 16, 1, pp. 28-48, (2008); Sani B., Kingsman B.G., Selecting the best periodic inventory control and demand forecasting methods for low demand items, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 48, 7, pp. 700-713, (1997); Shin D.W., Hwang E., Stationary bootstrapping for cointegrating regressions, Statistics & Probability Letters, 83, 2, pp. 474-480, (2013); Syntetos A.A., Boylan J.E., On the bias of intermittent demand estimates, International journal of production economics, 71, 1, pp. 457-466, (2001); Syntetos A.A., Babai M.Z., Gardner E.S., Forecasting intermittent inventory demands: simple parametric methods vs. bootstrapping, Journal of Business Research, 68, 8, pp. 1746-1752, (2015); Teunter R.H., Syntetos A.A., Babai M.Z., Intermittent demand: Linking forecasting to inventory obsolescence, European Journal of Operational Research, 214, 3, pp. 606-615, (2011); Tiwari M.K., Chatterjee C., Development of an accurate and reliable hourly flood forecasting model using wavelet–bootstrap–ANN (WBANN) hybrid approach, Journal of Hydrology, 394, 3, pp. 458-470, (2010); Willemain T.R., Smart C.N., Schwarz H.F., A new approach to forecasting intermittent demand for service parts inventories, International Journal of forecasting, 20, 3, pp. 375-387, (2004); Yamashina H., The service parts control problem, Engineering Costs and Production Economics, 16, 3, pp. 195-208, (1989); Zied M., Syntetos A., Teunter R., Int.

The present work analyzes the dust aerosol patterns over the arid environment of the Sistan region in southeastern Iran, by means of multiple satellite platforms aiming to reveal the spatio-temporal distribution and trends. The dataset includes records of Aerosol Index (AI) from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) (1978-2001) and 6-year AI records from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard Aura. Moreover, the aerosol optical depth is analyzed through 11-year records from Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard Terra (2000-2010) and from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2002-2011). The main focus is to determine the similarities and differences in dust variability over southwest Asia, in general, and the Sistan region, in particular. The results show a marked seasonal cycle with high aerosol loading during summer and lower in winter, while MISR, MODIS, and TOMS/OMI observations agree in both terms of monthly and seasonally mean spatial and temporal patterns. The higher aerosol concentrations during summer are interpreted as a result of the combined effect of the seasonal drying of the Hamoun lakes and the strong northerly Levar winds favoring dust erosion from the alluvial deposits in Sistan. After prolonged drought period, the dust aerosol load over the area has increased in the beginning of the 2000 s and decreased after 2004, thereby leading to an overall declining trend during the last decade. Such a trend is absent during the winter period when dust emission over the region is minimal. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Aerosol variability; Dust; Hamoun lakes; Remote sensing;

As a biological trait, HDL-C is strongly genetically determined, with a heritability index ranging from 40% to 60%. HDL represents an appealing therapeutic target due to its beneficial pleiotropic effects in preventing CHD. This review focuses on the genetic basis of cellular cholesterol efflux, the rate-limiting step in HDL biogenesis. There are several monogenic disorders (e.g., Tangier disease, caused by mutations within ABCA1) affecting HDL biogenesis. Importantly, many disorders of cellular cholesterol homeostasis cause a reduced HDL-C. We integrate information from family studies and linkage analyses with that derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and review the recent identification of micro-RNAs (miRNA) involved in cellular cholesterol metabolism. The identification of genomic pathways related to HDL may help pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches to promote cellular cholesterol efflux as a therapeutic modality to prevent atherosclerosis. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","ABCA1;

In 1974, an “AI Winter” occurred as many experts failed to deliver their promises on AI development and applications. As a result, the British and American governments reduced their funding for research in this field [22]. In the 1980s, the success of the expert systems led to the revival of AI research projects. An expert system is a software that is capable of reproducing the cognitive mechanisms of a human expert in a particular field based on a set of rules. Due to this success, the AI market reached a value of one billion dollars, which has motivated different governments to financially support academic projects again [33]. The exponential development of computing performance according to Moore’s Law made it possible, between 1990 and 2000, to exploit AI in previously uncommon areas such as mineral research or medical diagnosis. It was not until 1997 that a real media release took place when the famous AI Deep Blue created by IBM beat Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion [34].","Zahra S.A., George G., Absorptive capacity: A review, reconceptualization, and extension, Acad Manag Rev, 27, 2, pp. 185-203, (2002); Mariani M.M., Fosso Wamba S., Exploring how consumer goods companies innovate in the digital age: The role of big data analytics companies, J Bus Res, 121, pp. 338-352, (2020); Reis C., Ruivo P., Oliveira T., Faroleiro P., Assessing the drivers of machine learning business value, J Bus Res, 117, pp. 232-243, (2020); von Krogh G., Artificial Intelligence in Organizations: New Opportunities for Phenomenon-Based Theorizing, 4, pp. 404-409, (2018); Davenport T.H., Ronanki R., Artificial intelligence for the real world, Harv Bus Rev, 2018, 1, pp. 108-116, (2018); Shahzad I.A., Farrukh M., Wu Y., Trunk N., Human systems management: A retrospective of 40 years, Hum Syst Manag, 40, 1, pp. 15-30, (2021); Wamba-Taguimdje S.L., Fosso Wamba S., Kala Kamdjoug J.R., Tchatchouang Wanko C.E., Influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on firm performance: The business value of AI-based transformation projects, Bus Process Manag J, 26, 7, pp. 1893-1924, (2020); Wilson H.J., Daugherty P.R., Morini-Bianzino N., The jobs that artificial intelligence will create, MIT Sloan Manag Rev, 58, 4, pp. 14-16, (2017); Kilbride J., IBM study: The skills gap is not a myth, but can be addressed with real solutions, IBM Newsroom, (2019); Huang H., Kvasny L., Joshi K.D., Trauth E., Mahar J., Synthesizing IT job skills identified in academic studies, practitioner publications and job ads, SIGMIS CPR'09 - Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMIS Computer Personnel Research Conference, pp. 121-127, (2009); Koong K.S., Liu L.C., Net F.Y.I., A study of the demand for information technology professionals in selected internet job portals, J Inf Syst Educ, 13, 1, pp. 21-28, (2002); Litecky C., Igou A.J., Aken A., Skills in the management oriented IS and enterprise system job markets, SIGMIS-CPR'12 - Proceedings of the 2012 Computers and People Research Conference, pp. 35-43, (2012); Bolton C., Machova V., Kovacova M., Valaskova K., The power of human-Machine collaboration: Artificial intelligence, business automation, and the smart economy, Econ Manag Financ Mark, 13, 4, pp. 51-56, (2018); Santos S., Freire C., Barbosa I., Figueiredo H., Costa M.J., Assessing transversal competencies for the future of graduate work: An adaptation of the multiple mini-interviews method, ICERI2020 Proceedings, pp. 4112-4122, (2020); Mikalef P., Fjortoft S.O., Torvatn H.Y., Developing an artificial intelligence capability: A theoretical framework for business value, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, pp. 409-416, (2019); Russell Stuart J., Norvig P., Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach; McCulloch W.S., Pitts W.H., A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity, Syst Res Behav Sci A Sourceb, 5, 4, pp. 93-96, (2017); Turing I.B.A., Computing machinery and intelligence-AM Turing, Mind, 59, 236; McCarthy J., Minsky M.L., Rochester N., Shannon C.E., Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Project Proposal; O'Regan G., Unimation, Pillars of Computing, pp. 219-223; Weizenbaum J., ELIZA-A computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine, Commun ACM, 26, 1, pp. 23-28, (1983); Floridi L., AI and Its New Winter: From Myths to Realities.

An issue in SOC is to fulfill this promise with the development of models and algorithms supporting composition in an automatic (and automated) way, generating business processes from a set of available services and composition requirements, e.g., descriptions of end-user needs or business goals. Within the context of the widely accepted service-oriented architecture, i.e., Web services, this issue is currently known as the Web Service Composition (WSC) problem. WSC has been widely addressed in the past few years [15]. AI planning is increasingly applied to WSC due to its support for automatic composition from under-specified requirements [19]. An AI planning based algorithm usually provides a one-time solution, i.e., a plan, for a composition request. However, in the real and open world, change occurs frequently. Services may appear and disappear at any time in a unpredictable way, e.g., due to failure or the user mobility when services get out of reach. Service disappearance requires changing the original plan, and may cause some goals to be unreachable. End-user needs or business goals may also change over time. For example, one may want to add sightseeing functionality to a composition when arrived at a trip destination. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","","","","","","","","(2009); Beauche S., Poizat P., Automated service composition with adaptive planning, ICSOC 2008.

Both lead to drastic changes facing artificial intelligence (AI), cryptocurrencies and block-chain technologies, internet of things, technology-based surveillance, and other disruptive innovations. These developments facilitate the rise of the sharing economy and open for a variety of new entrepreneurial opportunities that businesses can take up. The novel entrepreneurial opportunities, however, imply a paradigmatic shift in the understanding of entrepreneurship. This book combines digital entrepreneurship with the sharing economy. It presents cutting-edge research for scholars and practitioners interested in either one of the topics - digital entrepreneurship or sharing economy - or their connection. The book addresses three major ways to become entrepreneurial in the sharing economy: digital entrepreneurship through creating novel sharing-economy platforms; technology entrepreneurship through the exploitation of sharing-economy platforms; and business model innovation or business model change influenced by the sharing economy. The book also highlights governance questions on digital entrepreneurship in the sharing economy, which are highly relevant for businesses, the economy, and society. The book will be of interested to researchers, academics, and students in the field of business and entrepreneurship, with a special focus on digital entrepreneurship. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

This requires new ways of thinking, acting, organizing and collaborating in our work. Faced with these challenges, the Human and Social Sciences have a leading role to play, alongside others, in designing, supporting and implementing these digital transformation projects. Their ambition is to participate in the development of innovative and empowering devices, that is to say, systems that are truly at the service of human beings and their activity, that empower these professionals to take action and that also provide occupational health services. This book takes a multidisciplinary look at the challenges of these digital transformations, making use of occupational psychology, ergonomics, sociology of uses, and management sciences. This viewpoint also helps provide epistemological, methodological and empirical insights to better understand and support the changes at work. © ISTE Ltd 2021.","","","","","","","","","Ajzen M., Donis C., Taskin L., Kaléidoscope des nouvelles formes d’organisation du travail: L’instrumentalisation stupide d’un idéal collaboratif et démocratique, Gestion 2000, 32, 3, pp. 125-147, (2015); Anastassova M., L’analyse ergonomique des besoins en amont de la conception de technologiesémergente: Le cas de la, (2006); Andonova Y., Vacher B., Nouvelles formes de visibilité des individus en entreprise: Technologie et temporalité, Communication et organisation, 44, 2013, pp. 5-14, (2013); Bain P., Taylor P., Entrapped by the electronic panopticon?

It is not true. Technology and human complement and do not compete with each other. Initially, it might create disruption in an existing ecosystem, later it helps in creating opportunities. Business must now embrace a new culture, where innovation and continuous learning are core components of the organizational culture. It sets the stage for agility, adaptability and growth. There are of course risks. AI and machine learning (ML) tools and techniques can be misused, intentionally or inadvertently. Obvious risk is misuse of AI by those intent on threatening individual’s physical, digital, financial, and emotional security. We have used worldwide real-life case scenarios to understand the importance of AI, its threats, and the role it plays in contributing toward the growth and prosperity of the society. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Often, the state space to be searched is huge, so optimizing the search is an important issue. In this paper, we consider the problem of visiting all states in the setting where transitions between states are generated by actions, and the (reachable) states are not known in advance. Some of the actions may commute, i.e., they result in the same state for every order in which they are taken. We show how to use commutativity to achieve full coverage of the states, while traversing a relatively small number of edges. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","Commutativity; Partial order reduction; State space search","","","","","","ANR SETI-06 DOTS; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (GR/T07343/02); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/F035845/1, NRFRF2009-08)","Acknowledgements The work of the second author has been partially supported by EPSRC under grant GR/T07343/02 by ESRC under grant ES/F035845/1, and by NRF under grant NRFRF2009-08.

With a network of 1.4 million km, it spends several hundred million Euros every year to maintain the existing network. Enedis is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to choose which parts of the network have to be renewed. The general approach of the targeting method presented in this paper was initially developed for underground Low Voltage (LV) networks and has been successfully used for three years. However, it could not be directly applied to the Medium Voltage (MV) network due to its different structure, with fewer but much longer feeders. MV network reliability is even more critical since faults on this network usually have a bigger impact on power supply. In order to fit some machine learning models on a portion of the network which has a size relevant for renewal investment, it has been necessary to develop complex data analytics, such as graph calculation, to get the useful features to train the models. The technologies used for data preparation allows the solution to be scaled up after successful tests on smaller dataset. We estimate that this new method applied over a three years period increases the number of faulty cables identified by 60%, compared to the current business as usual targeting method.

This was a 6-month, prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients who had discontinued anastrozole due to musculoskeletal symptoms were eligible to participate in this study, and received letrozole, which was initiated 1 month after anastrozole discontinuation. Musculoskeletal symptoms were systematically assessed for severity, location of the symptoms, presence of swelling and of morning stiffness by the oncologist patients when patients stopped taking their anastrozole, 1 month after the discontinuation of anastrozole, and 1, 3, and 6 months after initiating the letrozole therapy. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who discontinued letrozole due to the severe musculoskeletal symptoms. After switching from anastrozole therapy, and at the end of the 6-month letrozole treatment, 128 (71.5%) out of 179 patients (61.3 ± 8.4 years) continued with letrozole. Fifty-one patients (28.5%) discontinued treatment due to severe joint pain. At the end of the 6-month, 116 patients (73.9%) had arthralgia, 33 (21.0%) myalgia, 25 (15.9%) arthritis, 22 (14.0%) tendinitis, and 20 (12.7%) polyalgic syndrome. Bivariate analysis of the factors associated with letrozole discontinuation showed that the duration of a prior anastrozole treatment was a significant predictor (P = 0.04). This study shows that in patients intolerant to one AI, switching to another agent allows a higher proportion of patients to continue the therapy and maximize hormonal adjuvant therapy and disease outcome benefits. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Aromatase inhibitors;

Indeed, one or two satellites are not enough anymore to address applications relative to national security, disaster management or commercial monitoring. To answer these needs, Airbus put two satellite products on the market, the S250 optical and S250 radar. They are designed with constellations and complementarity in mind. An advanced ground segment ensures that customers can maximally exploit the great reactivity and huge acquisition capacity that come with a system combining several of these satellites. The paper describes one of the major implications of such constellations on the ground segment: the satellites can easily flood end users with image products of multiple types, therefore image analysis is necessary to automatically extract first level of information fast enough, allowing analysts to concentrate on their main skills and concerns. This way a decision can be made quickly whether to reprogram the constellation's acquisition plans, potentially crosscueing between optical and radar observations. The paper goes into the topics Airbus has been working on for endowing its systems with operational capabilities of image analysis using AI technologies. Technical and programmatic questions must be treated in many areas: training of new Machine Learning algorithms and re-training of existing ones on the new sensor products, the qualification, monitoring and maintenance of the algorithms and of the end-products, the timeliness at which the end products must be produced, the alignment of products generated by optical and radar algorithms in view of feeding sensor agnostic analytics products, the standardisation of algorithm interfaces for future capability extensions, the sizing of the IT infrastructure. When tackling these topics, considerations on the customers' business needs and system level considerations are of central importance. © 2020 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

IBN allows network operators to express an outcome or business objective without the low-level configurations necessary to program the network to achieve these demands. Existing research proposals for IBN introduce several systems to translate users intents into network infrastructure configurations. Despite the positive aspects of these proposals, they still suffer from many drawbacks. Some require users to learn a new intent definition language. Some others may lack the appropriate grammar to make these frameworks recognize the intent correctly. In this paper, we introduce a framework leveraging the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for network management from an operator utterances. In order to understand natural language, our framework uses the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning model based on recurrent neural networks (LSTM). The model has been improved by using word embedding and user feedback. As a proof of concept, we implement our framework for network management in a Global Internet eXchange Network and evaluate its practicality regarding NLP accuracy and network performance. © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Intent-Based Networking (IBN); Internet eXchange Points (IXP); Natural Language Processing (NLP); Software-Defined Networking (SDN)","Application programs; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Network management; Artificial intelligence; Global Internet; Intent-based networking; Internet exchange point; Internet exchange points; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Software-defined networking; Software-defined networkings; Software defined networking","","","","","NAFOS-TED, (102.02-2019.314); National Foundation for Science and Technology Development, NAFOSTED","This research is partially funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOS-TED) under grant number 102.02-2019.314","Bannour F., Souihi S., Mellouk A., Distributed SDN control: Survey, taxonomy, and challenges, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 20, 1, pp. 333-354, (2017); Pang L., Yang C., Chen D., Song Y., Guizani M., A survey on intent-driven networks, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 22862-22873, (2020); Dialoglow, (2021); Kiran M., Pouyoul E., Mercian A., Tierney B., Guok C., Monga I., Enabling intent to configure scientific networks for high performance demands, Future Generation Computer Systems, 79, pp. 205-214, (2018); Alsudais A., Keller E., Hey network, can you understand me, 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), pp. 193-198, (2017); Esposito F., Wang J., Contoli C., Davoli G., Cerroni W., Callegati F., A behavior-driven approach to intent specification for software-defined infrastructure management, 2018 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN), pp. 1-6, (2018); Selle Jacobs A., Jose Pfitscher R., Alves Ferreira R., Zambenedetti Granville L., Refining Network Intents for Self-Driving Networks, (2020); Scholte J.A., Internet governance, The Routledge Handbook of Transregional Studies, pp. 311-319, (2018); Tripathy J.K., Sethuraman S.C., Cruz M.V., Namburu A., Mangalraj P., Vijayakumar V., Comprehensive analysis of embeddings and pre-training in NLP, Computer Science Review, 42, (2021)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; Huawei; LG; Qualcomm; Samsung; Technology Innovation Institute (TII)","2022 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2022","16 May 2022 through 20 May 2022","Seoul","182043","15503607","978-153868347-7","","","English","IEEE Int Conf Commun","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137274269"

Moreover, the pressure to apply IT solutions forces companies to permanent search for the state-of-the-art technologies. It becomes, thus, necessary to support business processes with a tool that is able to inform, co-operate, act fast as well as replace a human in many business situations. Artificial intelligence (AI) based systems constitute the solution fulfilling such requirements. Quite recently AI started playing significant role in e-commerce world. Its new form is not the monolithic system of the past, but distributed artificial intelligence, known as intelligent agent technology.

However, the control flow does not capture what the process activities actually do when they are executed. Semantic annotations offer the opportunity to take this into account. Inspired by semantic Web service approaches such as OWL-S and WSMO, we consider process models in which the individual activities are annotated with logical preconditions and effects, specified relative to an ontology that axiomatizes the underlying business domain. Verification then addresses the overall process behavior, arising from the interaction between control-flow and behavior of individual activities. To this end, we combine notions from the workflow community with notions from the AI actions and change literature. We introduce a formal execution semantics for annotated business processes. We point out four verification tasks that arise, concerning precondition/effect conflicts, reachability, and executability. We examine the borderline between classes of processes that can, or cannot, be verified in polynomial time. For precondition/effect conflicts, we show that the borderline is the same as that of the logic underlying the ontology axioms. For reachability and executability, we identify a class of processes that can be verified in polynomial time by a fixpoint algorithm which we design for that purpose. We show that this class of processes is maximal in the sense that, when generalizing it in any of the most relevant directions, the validation tasks become computationally hard. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Business process management; Semantic technologies","Enterprise resource management; Ontology; Polynomial approximation; Semantics; Business domain; Business Process; Business process management; Business process model; Control flows; Control-flow; Execution semantics; Fixpoints; Polynomial-time; Process activities; Process behavior; Process model; Reachability; Semantic annotations; Semantic technologies; Verification task; Semantic Web","","","","","European Commission, EC","Acknowledgements We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their excellent feedback and insights.

After having presented (Section I) some of the fundamental challenges which the financial services industry puts onto decision technology, the motivations for the use of AI are related to a number of typical applications (Section II). This translates into suitable development and delivery environments (Section III), and to generic domain utilities required from shells or customized systems for that industry (Section IV). Markets and trades (Section V) are then shown to be well described in terms of knowledge representation and data structures, by object-oriented features embedded into logic programming environments. Conflict resolution strategies (Section VI), preference aggregation (Section VII), and revealed beliefs (Section VIII) are studied in detail as they represent cornerstones of the reasoning strategies used. A formal analysis of investment decision criteria (Section IX) demonstrates the complexity hereof, even with the help of search; an example from currency risk management (Section X) exemplifies this, while also demonstrating that sophisticated solutions can be built. Finally, intelligent information screens (Screens XI) are presented to stress the need for knowledge-based techniques in financial information retrieval, for fast selection of decision alternatives. © 1991 IEEE","Accounting; banking; conflict resolution; currency management; economics; expert systems; finance; information screens; insurance; internal rate of return; investment analysis; natural language front-ends; object-oriented programming; preference aggregation; reasoning; revealed beliefs","Data Processing, Business--Financial Applications; Financial Services; Knowledge Representation; Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","Dean J., Capital Budgeting, (1951); Fairley W., Jacoby H.D., Investment analysis using the probability distribution of the internal rate of return, Management Sci., 21, 12, pp. 1428-1437, (1975); Jean W.H., On multiple rates of return, J.

Moreover, we discuss exciting new opportunities for integrated localization and sensing applications, which will disrupt traditional design principles and revolutionize the way we live, interact with our environment, and do business. Regarding potential enabling technologies, 6G will continue to develop towards even higher frequency ranges, wider bandwidths, and massive antenna arrays. In turn, this will enable sensing solutions with very fine range, Doppler, and angular resolutions, as well as localization to cm-level degree of accuracy. Besides, new materials, device types, and reconfigurable surfaces will allow network operators to reshape and control the electromagnetic response of the environment. At the same time, machine learning and artificial intelligence will leverage the unprecedented availability of data and computing resources to tackle the biggest and hardest problems in wireless communication systems. As a result, 6G will be truly intelligent wireless systems that will provide not only ubiquitous communication but also empower high accuracy localization and high-resolution sensing services. They will become the catalyst for this revolution by bringing about a unique new set of features and service capabilities, where localization and sensing will coexist with communication, continuously sharing the available resources in time, frequency, and space. This work concludes by highlighting foundational research challenges, as well as implications and opportunities related to privacy, security, and trust. © 2013 IEEE.","6G; beamforming; cmWave; context-aware; IRS; ML/AI; mmWave; radar; security; sensing; SLAM; THz","Antenna arrays; Privacy by design; Degree of accuracy; Electromagnetic response; Enabling technologies; Reconfigurable surfaces; Research challenges; Sensing applications; Ubiquitous communication; Wireless communication system; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Suomen Akatemia, (24303208, 318927)","This work was supported by the Academy of Finland under Grant 318927 (project 6Genesis Flagship) and Grant 24303208.","Rappaport T.S., Xing Y., Kanhere O., Ju S., Madanayake A., Mandal S., Alkhateeb A., Trichopoulos G.C., Wireless communications and applications above 100 GHz: Opportunities and challenges for 6G and beyond, Ieee Access, 7, pp. 78729-78757, (2019); Bi Q., Ten trends in the cellular industry and an outlook on 6G, Ieee Commun.

Along with the increasing amount of data generated through online activities by customers, various hospitality companies have been investing in AI-powered solutions to be able to have better understanding about their customers and provide the relevant service to them accordingly. Despite knowing the impact on the customer service orientation, little is known about the impact of AI on the business process of a hospitality company. This paper explores the impact of the adoption of the AI on the business process of a hospitality company to have a better understanding of the extent of particular part of the business process that would benefit from the adoption of AI. It is apparent that Revenue Management and Marketing are the parts of business process within the hospitality industry that would have more positive impact on the adoption of AI. While AI-based marketing would be able to identify and target effectively high-value consumers, revenue management would be able to determine the right pricing strategy in real time due to the vast amount of available data and subsequently would have positive impact on the financial performance of the hospitality company. © 2021 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artifical intelligence; Business process; IHG; Revenue management; Technology adoption","","","","","","","","Bughin J., Hazan E., Ramaswamy S., Chui M., Allas T., Dahlstrom P., Trench .M., Artificial Intelligence: the Next Digital Frontier?, (2017); Fanderl H., Maechler N., Javetski B., Why the customer experience matters, Mckinsey & Company, (2016); Worldwide Hospitality Ranking: Which Changes in the Leading 12 Hotel Groups?, (2017); Annual Report.

A decisive business decision in a business transformation process of a traditional business environment into an automated AI-based business environment is the capacity of the decision-making system and the profile of the business transformation manager (BTM, or simply the manager). The manager and his team are supported by a holistic framework. The role of data science and the needed data modelling techniques are essential for managing data models in a transformation project.

These innovations, among other emerging entrepreneurial endeavors, will result in vast market disruption and innovation-driven growth; in Bower and Christensen’s (1995) terms, these trends encompass ‘disruptive innovation’. While the entrepreneurial landscape is fraught with constant bursts of innovation that reciprocally propel development of progressive modes of production, technology and business dynamics, entrepreneurship education (EE) does not reflect these innovations. The expectation is that EE will provide the relevant entrepreneurial-driven knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs), along with agile, creative mindsets and other psychological aspects (for example, self-effacement, motivation, intentions) to enable the implementation of such innovations into a viable, entrepreneurial business. However, research shows that EE for adult entrepreneurs still pursues conservative models, rather than forward-looking ones. This discrepancy between entrepreneurship and EE is echoed throughout the program types: the market is witnessing a gigantic outpouring of enabling systems (Matlay, 2006, 2008; Politis, 2005; Winkler et al., 2018), such as incubators, accelerators, academic programs for entrepreneurs, co-working spaces, corporate-based innovation centers, impact hubs, scaling accelerators, and digital accelerators, among others, but this substantial flux brings with it the question of relevant preparation for the entrepreneurial journey. The massively growing number of programs seems confusing to the learner-entrepreneurs, who need to determine which program will fit their needs as well as those of their stakeholders (Bischoff et al., 2018; Kariv et al., 2018; Steiner et al., 2018). Taken together, while entrepreneurship is characterized by vast innovation and boosted developments, the consequent implementation performance, which is attained through EE, is lagging behind due to the existing conventional EE modalities. These incongruities are the impetus for this book’s undertaking: to bring fresh views and perspectives on these prevailing gaps by illustrating innovative pedagogies and innovative programs through research studies, springing from an array of academic approaches, from various countries and various entrepreneurship programs. Specifically, this book aims to bridge some of the existing and evolving gaps between the entrepreneurship landscape and EE, to introduce a ‘disruptive innovation’-based look into EE, thus providing the groundwork for a better, more vigorous fit between the learners’ needs and EE focuses. This book offers new concepts and cases embodying EE and entrepreneurship learning (EL) in different countries, thereby covering a wide range of educational undertakings for entrepreneurs. The book aims to provide convergent, rather than divergent, perspectives on EE and EL. It sets out to deliver a constructive and focused research and learning agenda that closely matches the education and learning needs of nascent entrepreneurs and the corresponding programs that are being offered at all levels of the educational system. © Alain Fayolle, Dafna Kariv and Harry Matlay 2019.

The most important of these is Artificial Intelligence (AI). We name the paradigm “Business Artificial Intelligence (BAI)” the category of AI approaches that can create profitable new business models, earnest business-values, and more competitiveness, particularly Machine Learning (ML). However, ML algorithms are plentiful, and most of them necessitate specific Data structures, particular applicability features, and in-depth analysis of the business context. Because of these considerations, an increasing number of industrial ML-based applications fail. Therefore, it is natural to ask the question of applicability limits and ML algorithms selection, giving the business context. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose the evidence of the “No-Free-Lunch” (NFL) theorems to understand ML use’s applicability in business organizations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business Artificial Intelligence; Machine learning; ML applicability; No-Free-Lunch-Theorem; Theory of complexity","Competition; Business contexts; Business growth; Business organizations; Business value; In-depth analysis; New business models; Technological tools; Theory of complexity; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Adam S.P., Alexandropoulos S.A.N., Pardalos P.M., Vrahatis M.N., No free lunch theorem: A review, Approximation and Optimization.

The big industrial data is generated continuously during the execution of manufacturing processes. Hence, the predictive maintenance is among the most critical activities of the manufacturing processes concerned by the IDA. We believe that the maintenance activity can be managed by using Machine Learning (ML) methodologies, especially the data analytics solutions based on meta-learning. The challenge is then to facilitate the application of ML by the industry 4.0 actors, who are supposedly not AI specialists. The automated machine learning (AutoML) seems to be the area dealing with this challenge. In this paper, we primarily discuss the challenges of assisting industry 4.0 actors to implement ML algorithms in the context of predictive maintenance. Later on, we present a novel AutoML based framework for the industry 4.0 actors and researchers, who presumably have limited expertise in ML domain. It aims to enable them to generate ML-based data analytics solutions and deploy these solutions in manufacturing workflows. Specifically, the framework implements the approaches based on meta-learning and uses the web semantic concepts in this regard. In the context of Industry 4.0 such approaches lead to the implementation of the smart factory concepts. It makes the factory processes more proactive on the basis of predictive knowledge extracted from the various manufacturing devices, sensors, and business processes in real-time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AutoML; Data analytics; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Meta-learning; Ontologies","Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Maintenance; Predictive analytics; Semantics; Analytic solution; Automated machine learning; Data analytics; Domain experts; Industrial datum; Machine-learning; Manufacturing process; Metalearning; Ontology's; Predictive maintenance; Data Analytics","","","","","Calais France; Université du Littoral Côte d'Opale, ULCO","Acknowledgements This work has been supported, in part, by Hestim, CNRST Morocco, and University of the Littoral Cote d’Opale, Calais France.","Garouani M., Ahmad A., Bouneffa M., Et al., Towards big industrial data mining through explainable automated machine learning, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, (2022); Sharp M., Ak R., Hedberg T., A survey of the advancing use and development of machine learning in smart manufacturing, JMS, 48, pp. 170-179, (2018); Reif M., Et al., Automatic classfier selection for non-experts, Pattern Anal Appl, 17, 1, pp. 83-96, (2014); Villanueva Zacarias A.G., Reimann P., Mitschang B., A frame-work to guide the selection and configuration of machine-learning-based data analytics solutions in manufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 72, pp. 153-158, (2018); Garouani M., Et al., Towards the automation of industrial data science: a meta-learning based approach.

This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advanced technologies; artificial intelligence; human resource management; Intelligent automation; international business; robotics; systematic review","","","","","","","","Abraham M., Niessen C., Schnabel C., Lorek K., Grimm V., Moslein K., Wrede M., Electronic monitoring at work: The role of attitudes, functions, and perceived control for the acceptance of tracking technologies, Human Resource Management Journal, 29, 4, pp. 657-675, (2019); Alcaraz J.M., Domenech M., Tirado F., eHR software, multinational corporations and emerging China: Exploring the role of information through a postcolonial lens, Information and Organization, 22, 2, pp. 106-124, (2012); Aleksander I., Partners of humans: A realistic assessment of the role of robots in the foreseeable future, Journal of Information Technology, 32, 1, pp. 1-9, (2017); Ancarani A., Di Mauro C., Mascali F., Backshoring strategy and the adoption of Industry 4.0: Evidence from Europe, Journal of World Business, 54, 4, pp. 360-371, (2019); Andresen M., Bergdolt F., A systematic literature review on the definitions of global mindset and cultural intelligence–merging two different research streams, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 28, 1, pp. 170-195, (2017); Araujo T., Living up to the chatbot hype: The influence of anthropomorphic design cues and communicative agency framing on conversational agent and company perceptions, Computers in Human Behavior, 85, pp. 183-189, (2018); Bailey C., Madden A., Alfes K., Fletcher L., The meaning, antecedents and outcomes of employee engagement: A narrative synthesis, International Journal of Management Reviews, 19, 1, pp. 31-53, (2017); Behrend T.S., Thompson L.F., Similarity effects in online training: Effects with computerized trainer agents, Computers in Human Behavior, 27, 3, pp. 1201-1206, (2011); Bell B.S., Kanar A.M., Kozlowski S.W., Current issues and future directions in simulation-based training in North America, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 19, 8, pp. 1416-1434, (2008); Bhave D.P., Teo L.H., Dalal R.S., Privacy at work: A review and a research agenda for a contested terrain, Journal of Management, 46, 1, pp. 127-164, (2020); Bondarouk T., Brewster C., Conceptualising the future of HRM and technology research, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 27, 21, pp. 2652-2671, (2016); Bondarouk T., Harms R., Lepak D., Does e-HRM lead to better HRM service?, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 28, 9, pp. 1332-1362, (2017); Bondarouk T., Parry E., Furtmueller E., Electronic HRM: Four decades of research on adoption and consequences, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 28, 1, pp. 98-131, (2017); Buckley P., Minette K., Joy D., Michaels J., The use of an automated employment recruiting and screening system for temporary professional employees: A case study, Human Resource Management, 43, 2-3, pp. 233-241, (2004); Cano-Kollmann M., Hannigan T.J., Mudambi R., Global innovation networks–organizations and people, Journal of International Management, 24, 2, pp. 87-92, (2018); Chang Y.Y., Smale A., Expatriate characteristics and the stickiness of HRM knowledge transfers, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 24, 12, pp. 2394-2410, (2013); Chao G.T., Kozlowski S.W., Employee perceptions on the implementation of robotic manufacturing technology, Journal of Applied Psychology, 71, 1, pp. 70-76, (1986); Christofi M., Vrontis D., Thrassou A., Shams S.R., Triggering technological innovation through cross-border mergers and acquisitions: A micro-foundational perspective, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 146, pp. 148-166, (2019); Christofi M., Leonidou E., Vrontis D., Marketing research on mergers and acquisitions: A systematic review and future directions, International Marketing Review, 34, 5, pp. 629-651, (2017); Colbert A., Yee N., George G., The digital workforce and the workplace of the future, Academy of Management Journal, 59, 3, pp. 731-739, (2016); Cooke F.L., Liu M., Liu L.A., Chen C.C., Human resource management and industrial relations in multinational corporations in and from China: Challenges and new insights, Human Resource Management, 58, 5, pp. 455-471, (2019); Cooke F.L., Veen A., Wood G., What do we know about cross-country comparative studies in HRM?

However, the research in this domain is scattered and mainly focuses on one of the stages of the supply chain. Due to this, it is difficult to comprehend the work conducted in the distinct domain of the fashion and apparel industry. Therefore, this paper aims to study the impact and the significance of artificial intelligence in the fashion and apparel industry in the last decades throughout the supply chain. Following this objective, we performed a systematic literature review of research articles (journal and conference) associated with artificial intelligence in the fashion and apparel industry. Articles were retrieved from two popular databases 'Scopus' and 'Web of Science' and the article screening was completed in five phases resulting in 149 articles. This was followed by article categorization which was grounded on the proposed taxonomy and was completed in two steps. First, the research articles were categorized according to the artificial intelligence methods applied such as machine learning, expert systems, decision support system, optimization, and image recognition and computer vision. Second, the articles were categorized based on supply chain stages targeted such as design, fabric production, apparel production, and distribution. In addition, the supply chain stages were further classified based on business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) to give a broader outlook of the industry. As a result of the categorizations, research gaps were identified in the applications of AI techniques, at the supply chain stages and from a business (B2B/B2C) perspective. Based on these gaps, the future prospects of the AI in this domain are discussed. These can benefit the researchers in academics and industrial practitioners working in the domain of the fashion and apparel industry. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; big data analytics; expert systems; fashion and apparel industry; machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data Analytics; Decision support systems; Expert systems; Image recognition; Learning systems; Machine learning; Apparel industry; Applications of AI; Artificial intelligence methods; Business to business; Business-to-consumer; Future prospects; Industrial practitioners; Systematic literature review; Supply chains","","","","","Framework of Erasmus; Framework of Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Program-SMDTex; European Commission, EC","This work was supported by the European Commission through the Framework of Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Program-SMDTex.","Demand Share of Apparel Market Worldwide from 2005 to 2020, by Region; Worldwide Forecasted Sales Growth in the Fashion Industry in 2019, by Region; Sweeny G., It's the second dirtiest thing in the world-And you're wearing it, AlterNet, (2015); Shang X., Liu X., Xiong G., Cheng C., Ma Y., Nyberg T.R., Social manufacturing cloud service platform for the mass customization in apparel industry, Proc.

On the data side, extremely large data sets can be stored and processed, even real-time, and at reasonable cost. On the analytical side, methods are no longer limited to hard-coded (business) rules or statistics, but leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and particularly Machine Learning (ML). In this paper we argue that Big Data's quickest business wins and first tangible impact is in the domain of customer/consumer analytics, summarized as Digital Consumer Journey Analytics. Such journeys are constructed from people's movement and navigational patterns in both the virtual and physical world; while individual data points are at first not very expressive, the picture created by continuous collection of ubiquitous data and their history, allows to unveil almost any identity profile. Under this increasingly digital environment, staying in the relevant set of consumers is of utmost importance for businesses. Big Data Analytics can support by, e. g., driving product and service design and customer experience improvements. However, there are increasing limitations to the possibilities of Big Data Analytics in consumer businesses, in particular Data Privacy and Data Ethics. Businesses have to deal with a growing appetite of legislation and prudential regulation, e. g., the EU GDPR. The challenge is to make data-driven offerings trusted in the digital age. In this paper we will illustrate the journey in an insurance business to grow successful Big Data Use Cases in Consumer Analytics and discuss Privacy by Design (PbD) and Private Enhancing Technologies (PET) as means to build trusted data-driven products and services. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.","","","","","","","","","Edelman D.C., Branding in the digital age, Harvard business review, pp. 62-69, (2010); Elzinga D., Mulder S., Vetvik O., The consumer decision journey, McKinsey Quarterly, (2009); Edelman D., Singer M., The new consumer decision journey, McKinsey Quarterly, (2015); Pine B.J., Gilmore J.H., Welcome to the experience economy, Harvard Business Review, (1998); deMontjoye Y.-A., Hidalgo C., Verleysen M., Blondel V., Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility, Scientific reports, (2013); Schaar P., Privacy by design, Identity in the Information Society, pp. 267-274, (2010); Cavoukian A., Jonas J., Privacy by design in the age of big data, Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Ontario, Canada, (2012); Strong E.K., The psychology of selling and advertising, McGraw-Hill book Company, (1925); Reichheld F.F., The one number you need to grow, Harvard business review, pp. 46-55, (2003); Chen D., Zhao H., Data Security and Privacy Protection Issues in Cloud Computing, Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, (2012); The 'Social' Credit Score: Separating the Data from the Noise,, (2013); Shapiro S., Washington N., Miller J., Snyder J., McEwen J., Privacy Engineering Framework, MITRE Privacy Community of Practice.; Dwork C., Differential privacy, Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security, pp. 338-340, (2011); Coulouris G., Dollimore J., Kindberg T., Distributed Systems-Concepts and Design, (2005); Manifesto for agile software development","A.

Hence, we now are urging: “Rulers of the world, unite!” In this article, we outline six debates surrounding AI in areas like artificial superintelligence, geographical progress, and robotics; in doing so, we shed light on what is fact and what is utopia. Then, using the PESTEL framework, we talk about the six dilemmas of AI and its potential threat and use. Finally, we provide six directions on the future of AI regarding its requirements and expectations, looking at enforcement, employment, ethics, education, entente, and evolution. Understanding AI's potential future will enable governments, corporations, and societies at large (i.e., the rulers of this world) to prepare for its challenges and opportunities.

This paper addresses this problem in a propositional framework. We introduce the decision problem distance-sat, which consists in determining whether a propositional formula admits a model that disagrees with a given partial interpretation on at most d variables. The complexity of distance-sat and of several restrictions of it are identified. Two algorithms based on the well-known Davis/Logemann/Loveland search procedure for the satisfiability problem sat are presented so as to solve distance-sat for CNF formulas. Their computational behaviors are compared with the ones offered by sat solvers on sat encodings of distance-sat instances. The empirical evaluation allows us to draw firm conclusions about the respective performances of the algorithms and to relate the difficulty of distance-sat with the difficulty of sat from the practical side. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.","Computational complexity; Satisfiability","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computational methods; Decision making; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Decision problems; Distance-sat; Artificial intelligence","","","","","IRCICA Consortium; IUT de Lens; Université d’Artois; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","Acknowledgements Many thanks to Vincent Vidal for his help.

It provides insights into key topics, citation patterns, publication activities, the status of collaborations between contributors over past studies, aggregated data intelligence, and analytics research contributions. The study provides a retrospective review of published content in the field of data intelligence and analytics. The findings indicate that field research has been concentrated mainly on emerging technologies' intelligence capabilities rather than on human–artificial intelligence in decision-making performance in the public sector. This study extends an ambidexterity theory in decision support, which enlightens how this ambidexterity can be encouraged and how it affects decision outcomes. The study emphasises the importance of the public sector adoption of data intelligence and analytics, as well as its efficiency.

Unfortunately, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) making up more than 95% of all businesses is the hardest hit sector. This has urged SMEs to rethink their operations to survive through pandemic events. One key area is the use of new technologies pertaining to digital transformation for optimizing pandemic preparedness and minimizing business disruptions. This is especially true from the perspective of digitizing asset management methodologies in the era of Industry 4.0 under pandemic environments. Incidentally, human-centric approaches have become increasingly important in predictive maintenance through the exploitation of digital tools, especially when the workforce is increasingly interacting with new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things devices for condition monitoring in equipment maintenance services. In this research, we propose an AI-based human-centric decision support framework for predictive maintenance in asset management, which can facilitate prompt and informed decision-making under pandemic environments. For predictive maintenance of complex systems, an enhanced trust-based ensemble model is introduced to undertake imbalanced data issues. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is incorporated to exploit the tacit knowledge elucidated from subject matter experts for providing decision support. Evaluations with both benchmark and real-world databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for addressing imbalanced data issues in predictive maintenance tasks.

There is an abundant literature on the technical performance of AI applications in many clinical fields (e.g. radiology, ophthalmology). This article aims to bring forward the importance of studying organizational readiness to integrate AI into health care delivery. Design/methodology/approach: The reflection is based on our experience in digital health technologies, diffusion of innovations and healthcare organizations and systems. It provides insights into why and how organizational readiness should be carefully considered. Findings: As an important step to ensure successful integration of AI and avoid unnecessary investments and costly failures, better consideration should be given to: (1) Needs and added-value assessment; (2) Workplace readiness: stakeholder acceptance and engagement; (3) Technology-organization alignment assessment and (4) Business plan: financing and investments. In summary, decision-makers and technology promoters should better address the complexity of AI and understand the systemic challenges raised by its implementation in healthcare organizations and systems. Originality/value: Few studies have focused on the organizational issues raised by the integration of AI into clinical routine. The current context is marked by a perplexing gap between the willingness of decision-makers and technology promoters to capitalize on AI applications to improve health care delivery and the reality on the ground, where it is difficult to initiate the changes needed to realize their full benefits while avoiding their negative impacts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Decision-making; Health care delivery; Healthcare organizations; Organizational readiness","article; artificial intelligence; decision making; diffusion; expectation; health care delivery; health care organization; investment; ophthalmology; promoter region; radiology; workplace","","","","","CIHR-IHSPR; Institut national d'excellence en santé et services sociaux; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, IRSC; Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé, FRQS","Funding text 1: H.

However, language barriers impacting business, cross-lingual and cross-cultural communication are still omnipresent. Language Technologies (LTs) are a powerful means to break down these barriers. While the last decade has seen various initiatives that created a multitude of approaches and technologies tailored to Europe's specific needs, there is still an immense level of fragmentation. At the same time, AI has become an increasingly important concept in the European Information and Communication Technology area. For a few years now, AI - including many opportunities, synergies but also misconceptions - has been overshadowing every other topic. We present an overview of the European LT landscape, describing funding programmes, activities, actions and challenges in the different countries with regard to LT, including the current state of play in industry and the LT market. We present a brief overview of the main LT-related activities on the EU level in the last ten years and develop strategic guidance with regard to four key dimensions. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC","Infrastructural issues; Infrastructures; Multilingualism; National and international projects; Policy issues","Cross-cultural communication; European languages; Information and Communication Technologies; Key dimensions; Language barriers; Language technology; Multilingualism; Strategic guidance","","","","","AI4EU, (732630); Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe; EU-funded; European Language Grid, (761758); European Language Resource Coordination; HumanE AI, (825619); National Science Foundation, NSF; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (825627); Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, AI2; Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (13/RC/2106); Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT, (LM2018101 LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (PINFRA/22117/2016 PORTULANCLARIN)","Funding text 1: CLAIRE The Confederation of Laboratories for AI Research in Europe (CLAIRE) was launched on 18 June 2018 with a vision document signed by 600 senior researchers and key stakeholders in AI.20 That document calls for “Excellence across All of AI. For all of Europe. With a Human-Centred Focus.” CLAIRE has since garnered support for that vision by more than 3,300 individuals from Europe, with about two thirds being AI experts. Additionally, the world’s largest network of AI labs across Europe has been created with more than 350 labs, representing over 20,000 employees. CLAIRE is now supported by nine EU Member State governments. CLAIRE collaborates closely with HumanE-AI, AI4EU, and plays a crucial coordinating role in many of the “AI excellence centres” proposals (ICT-48-2020).

Following META-NET’s work to assess the situation of the LT landscape in Europe (Rehm et al., 2016b), the NCCs were asked to provide information about corresponding funding programmes, activities and challenges in their countries (cf. Table 2 for a summary). Austria: Currently, there is no specific funding programme for LT services, tools or resources. However, there is an initiative for digitalisation in industry, administration, and research. Recently, a new AI initiative was announced; the concretefundingprogrammesareyettofollow. Whilefor German, in general, resources and LTs are widely available, very little is available for Austrian German. Belgium: There is no specific funding programme, a lack of a joint programme with The Netherlands is also apparent. Belgium is currently re-applying for CLARIN membership and has limited funding for a CLARIAH programme in Flanders but the latter currently does not fund NLP research. Fragmentary research efforts on language-centric AI exist in National Science Foundation funding schemes. Bulgaria: There is a need for a large collection of data sets and resources, services and tools for spoken language.","A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe, (Communication) COM, 192, pp. 3-4, (2015); Language Equality in the Digital Age, (2018); Gavrilidou M., Labropoulou P., Desipri E., Piperidis S., Papageorgiou H., Monachini M., Frontini F., Declerck T., Francopoulo G., Arranz V., Mapelli V., The META-SHARE Metadata Schema for the Description of Language Resources, Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012), pp. 1090-1097, (2012); Labropoulou P., Gkirtzou K., Gavriilidou M., Deligiannis M., Galanis D., Piperidis S., Rehm G., Berger M., Mapelli V., Rigault M., Arranz V., Choukri K., Backfried G., Perez J.

To this end we proceed in two steps. First a family of optimally growing primary streaks U issued by the optimal vortices of the Poiseuille laminar solution is computed by direct numerical simulation for a set of finite amplitudes AI of the primary vortices. An adjoint technique is then used to compute the maximum growth and the finite time Lyapunov exponents of secondary perturbations growing on top of these primary base flows. The secondary optimals take into full account the non-normality and the local instabilities of the tangent operator all along the temporal evolution of the primary flows. The most amplified optimal perturbations are sinuous and realized in correspondence of streaks that are locally unstable. The combinations of primary and secondary perturbations optimal for transition are then explored using direct numerical simulations. It is shown that the minimum initial energy is realized by a large set of these combinations, revealing new paths to transition. Surprisingly we find that transition can be efficiently obtained even using secondary perturbations alone, in the absence of primary optimal vortices. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","Direct numerical simulation; Lyapunov methods; Numerical models; Adjoint techniques; Finite-time Lyapunov exponent; Local instability; Optimal perturbation; Plane Poiseuille flow; Subcritical transition; Tangent operators; Temporal evolution; Vortex flow","","","","","","","Cossu C., An optimality condition on the minimum energy threshold in subcritical instabilities, C.

The impacts of big data go beyond the commercial world, creating significant societal impact, from improving healthcare systems to the energy-efficient operation of cities and transportation infrastructure, to increasing the transparency and efficiency of public administration. In order to exploit the potential of big data to create value for society, citizens and businesses, Europe needs to embrace new technology, applications, use cases and business models within and across various sectors and domains. In the early part of the 2010s, a clear strategy centring around the notion of the European Big Data Value Ecosystem started to take form with the aim of increasing the competitiveness of European industries through a data ecosystem which tackles the fundamental elements of big data value, including the ecosystem, research and innovation, business, policy and regulation, and the emerging elements of data-driven AI and common European data spaces. This chapter describes the big data value ecosystem and its strategic importance. It details the challenges of creating this ecosystem and outlines the vision and strategy of the Big Data Value Public-Private Partnership and the Big Data Value Association, which together formed the core of the ecosystem, to make Europe the world leader in the creation of big data value. Finally, it details the elements of big data value which were addressed to realise this vision. © The Author(s) 2021.

Fifty papers have been selected from the thirteen conferences and each of them is described in a short subsection individually written by one of the 24 authors. These subsections attempt to place the paper discussed in the context of the development of AI and Law, while often offering some personal reactions and reflections. As a whole, the subsections build into a history of the last quarter century of the field, and provide some insights into where it has come from, where it is now, and where it might go. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial intelligence and law; Legal informatics; Models of legalReasoning","Management; AI and law; Informatics; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Research and Development department","On a personal level, I began my professional career working on History Assistant, beginning in the late 1990s. This work led to one of my first publications, namely Al-Kofahi et al. (2001). Now, over a decade later, after taking leave twice for graduate school and a postdoctoral fellowship, I continue to work and do research in the Research and Development department at Thomson Reuters. In addition, many of the original contributors to the History Assistant project have remained to face the challenges confronted by the corporate Research and Development group. Under Peter’s guidance and leadership, we have collectively brought many innovative products into the legal marketplace, including the ResultsPlus document recommendation engine on Westlaw and most notably WestlawNext, launched in 2010.","Gotnes T., Van Der Hoek W., Tennenholtz M., Wooldridge M.A., Power in normative systems, Proceedings of AAMAS, pp. 145-152, (2009); Adelman L., Gualtieri J., Riedl S.L., A multifaceted approach to evaluating expert systems, Artif Intell des Anal Manufact, 8, 4, pp. 289-306, (1994); Aleven V., Teaching Case-based Argumentation Through An Example and Models, (1997); Aleven V., Ashley K.D., Evaluating A Learning Environment for Case-based Argumentation Skills.

Based on a sample of 867 AI systems applied to business processes and building on the, Äúthree-dimensional concurrent engineering, Äù framework we provide evidence that Human Centric Artificial Intelligence brings value to business processes, may transform products, and shape business ecosystems.

The 1988 one billion metric tonnes world-wide production of cement accounted for one billion metric tonnes of C02 release, i.e. 5% of the 1988 world C02 emission (human activity only). This is equivalent to the C02 emission by the entire Japanese activity. The use of lesser amounts of calcium-based cements could be achieved through their pm1ial replacement by alkaliactivated alumino-silicate materials ,which do not release large quantities of C02 in their manufacture. The fostering of low-C02 high-alkali-based cements will mean a dramatic change in the research and development presently carried out in USA and other countries. Alkalis are generally thought of as the cause of deleterious alkali-aggregate-reaction. As a consequence, the tendency has been to avoid any addition of alkali por1land cement products , and often require the cement manufacturers to supply low-alkali cements. The use of MASNMR spectrography for the detcnninations of composition of alkali-activated cements, in combination with standard ASTM C 227 bar expansion, allows us to predict the potential for alkali-aggregate reaction. Our preliminary study involving 27 AI and 29Si MASNMR spectroscopy revealed that the alkali-activated alumino-silicate cements are the synthetic analogues of natural pozzolans which are known to effectively suppress the alkaliaggregate reaction. These cements, even with alkali contents as high as 9.2% do not generate any deleterious alkali-aggregate reaction, according to ASTM C 227 bar expansion test. Industrial experience based on the usc of alkali-activated slags in Eastern Europe since 1964, associated with the commercially produced alkali-activated cements in the US since 1988, suggest that high-alkali cements will ultimately improve the concrete used in buildings and highways, and also serve our global need by a) reducing the emission of C02 b) reducing the energy consumption during cement manufacturing. In terms of a 5% growth scenario, the predicted Business as Usual (BaU) world cement production for the year 2015 equals 35(X) million metric tonnes. Based on an amount of blended Pm1land cement production in the order of 1850 million metric tonnes (1000 Mt. Pm1land + 560 Mt. slag+ 290 Mt. fly ash), in the 21st century, the need for novel alkaliactivated cementitious materials could be in the range of 1650 million metric tonnes. © 1994 American Concrete Institute.

(1) What are the main strategies for retailers to improve their AI-related data management? (2) How do retailers use AI to provide solutions in business processes? (3) What are the value creation logics of AI applications in retail? Design/methodology/approach: Data- and solution-centric perspectives, as well as the concept of value creation logics, serve to build the analytical framework. The grounded theory multiple-case analysis of 54 representative retailers' adoptions and implementations of AI between 2008 and 2018 help to investigate the firm's AI applications and value creation logics. Findings: This study identifies five main strategies for AI-related data management and reveals 28 AI-powered solutions, changing 14 business processes, with five management areas involved in AI applications to create value via four logics: automation, hyper-personalization, complementarity and innovation. Research limitations/implications: This paper advances the research into AI applications in business and management by providing research propositions with an integrative framework to understand how firms can use and benefit from AI. However, secondary data and exploratory study still limit the findings. Practical implications: The findings provide retail managers with an analytical framework that can help them to develop a rationale for their strategic choices and best practices relating to the adoption and implementation of AI. Originality/value: The originality of this paper lies in its systematic examination of AI applications and value creations in retail. The findings provide managers with guidance, rational strategic choices and best practices to take action to embrace the great business opportunities created by AI technologies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI application; Artificial intelligence; Digital transformation; Retail sector; Value creation","","","","","","NEOMA Business School, (408359)","The author is grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions, which have helped the author significantly improve the quality and exposition of this paper.

It is widely used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, topographic mapping, agricultural censuses and disaster prevention. However, traditional satellite remote sensing is subject to high cost and long data acquisition cycles, and it is difficult for users to get the data in time. These problems result in insufficient data supply capacity of remote sensing satellites, which leads to difficulties in supporting daily business applications and establishing a fast-growing business model business models. The small satellite segment has seen rapid market growth and technological advancements since 2013 following the multiple successful launches, most notably the Planet, Spire and others. Economies of scale during production are one of the core advantages of the small satellites segment, thus allowing for significant cost reduction throughout their development and production cycles. At the same time, big data analysis and the artificial intelligence (AI) industries are booming. Periodically full coverage data from small satellites provides a data source for data mining and periodic statistics for a wide range of targets. It provides huge opportunities and extension channels for the applications of big data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in Earth observation (EO). The present paper describes research on the technical and commercial increment of the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. In the first section of the paper, a literature review of the common downstream space activities along with identifying the limitations of Earth Observation in terms of high cost and long data acquisition cycles is presented. In the second section, the paper outlines a 4G case study to show that how the improvement of infrastructure brings new application scenarios, verticals and consumers. In the third section, the paper considers the possible new market opportunities of the 5G technology in the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. Finally, it concludes by proposing two prototype models in agriculture monitoring and disaster and emergency responses, assesses the technical and commercial increment relative to the current business.

In previous works, three different layers were defined to be responsible of the cyber physical security of any given system: the network layer, the device layer and the human factor layer. However, statistics and experience have proven that the third factor is the weakest link in the cyber security of any company. This factor is divided into two subsections: the ignorance of the user (which will be treated in this paper) and the malignancy of the user. As the two previous layers were presented in previous works, this paper will focus on enhancing security by raising the cyber awareness of users thus creating a human firewall. For that, an AI-based conversational bot that focuses on cyber threat awareness and acts as a personal assistant relating to security issues was developed. This bot is based on AI-approach and it is used to make the interaction with the user appealing and friendly through the use of WhatsApp as a mean of communication. The implementation and testing of this bot has shown great interest for the users who have tried it due to its simplicity, the quality of deliverable data and the evaluation technique.  © 2021 IEEE.","AI chatbot; Cyber Awareness; Cyber Security; Human Factor Level; Human Firewall; Secured System","Computer system firewalls; Human engineering; Network layers; AI chatbot; Business operation; Chatbots; Cybe awareness; Cyber security; Cyber-Physical securities; Different layers; Human factor level; Human firewall; Secured system; Cybersecurity","","","","","","","Disparte D., Furlow C., The Best Cybersecurity Investment You Can Make Is Better Training, Harvard Business Review, 16, (2016); Hajal G.E.L., Abi Zeid Daou R., Ducq Y., Borcsok J., Designing and validating a cost effective safe network: Application to a PACS system, 5th International Conference on Advances in Biomedical Engineering (ICABME), Tripoli, Lebanon, (2019); El Hajal R., Abi Z., Daou G., Ducq Y., A novel approach to classify vulnerabilities based on authenticated measurements, Catse International Conference on IT Convergence and Security, (2021); Bernard T., Cowley S., Equifax Breach Caused by Lone Employee?s Error, The NewYork Times, 10, (2017); Whittaker Z., Veeam Server Lapse Leaks over 440 Million Email Addresses, 9, (2018); Egnash M., Defense Travel System Data Breach Leaves Thousands Open to ID Theft, 3, (2018); Klahr R., Shah J., Sheriffs P., Rossington T., Pestell G., Button M., Victoria Wang V., Cyber security breaches survey 2017, Ipsos MORI, (2017); Heller B., Proctor M., Dean Mah D., Jewell L., Cheung B., Freudbot: An Investigation of Chatbot Technology in Distance Education, EdMedia: World Conference on Educational Media & Technology, Montreal, (2005); Molnar G., Szuts Z., The Role of Chatbots in Formal Education, IEEE 16th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY), Subotica, (2018); Riikkinen M., Saarijarvi H., Sarlin P., Lahteenmaki I., Using artificial intelligence to create value in insurance, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 36, 6, pp. 1145-1168, (2018); Agus Santoso H., Anisa N., Winarsih S., Mulyanto E., Wilujeng G., Enggar S.S., Sukmana S., Rustad M., Rohman S., Nugraha A., Firdausillah F., Dinus Intelligent Assistance (DINA) Chatbot for University Admission Services, International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication, Semarang, (2018); Rosruen N., Samanchuen T., Chatbot Utilization for Medical Consultant System, 3rd Technology Innovation Management and Engineering Science International Conference (TIMES-iCON), Bangkok, (2018); Nuruzzaman M., Hussain O.K., A Survey on Chatbot Implementation in Customer Service Industry through Deep Neural Networks, IEEE 15th International Conference on E-Business Engineering (ICEBE), xi'An, (2018); Khanna A., Pandey B., Vashishta K., Kalia K., Bhale P., Das T., A study of today?s A.I.Through chatbots and rediscovery of machine intelligence, International Journal of U-and E-Service, Science and Technology, 8, pp. 277-284, (2015); Llc W., Whatsapp; Facebook Capacity, Quality Rating, and Messaging Limits; Foundation P.S., Python; Lic W., WhatsApp Web; Devlin J., Chang M., Lee K., Toutanova K., BERT: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language, CoRR, Vol. Abs/ 1810 04805, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd IEEE International Multidisciplinary Conference on Engineering Technology, IMCET 2021","8 December 2021 through 10 December 2021","Beirut","176294","","978-166540587-4","","","English","IEEE Int.

The MORPHEMIC project proposes a unique way of adapting and optimizing cloud computing applications by introducing the novel concepts of polymorphic architecture and proactive adaptation. It allows application adaptation based on forecasted usage, number of users and other business metrics. The applications will be automatically reconfigured based on forecasting future needs. Also, the architecture of the applications can be changed, to better utilize available hardware. The MORPHEMIC User Interfaces include the tools available for the user to access all MORPHEMIC Platform features for cross-cloud applications modeled in CAMEL language to manage cloud deployment, optimization and monitoring. The User Interface acts as a central MORPHEMIC element where the execution task of applications deployment and the polymorphic adaptation is implemented by the Web User Interface Client which includes managing heterogeneous resources such as cloud offers and material accelerators, managing CAMEL Models, optimizing, deploying and monitoring the cross-cloud Application. The developed User Interface takes into consideration the quality of the User eXperience and the use case studies requirements as they represent the first users of the MORPHEMIC Platform.  © 2021 The Authors.","AI chips; Artificial Intelligence; Big data; Cloud; crosscloud; FPGA; GPUs; HPC; multi-access computing and networking; open standards; Open-source projects; Optimization; TPUs","Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Graphical user interfaces; Open systems; Program processors; AI chip; Cloud applications; Crosscloud; HPC; Multi-access computing and networking; Multiaccess; Open source projects; Open Standards; Optimisations; TPU; Big data","","","","","Horizon 2020, (871643)","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 871643.

This leads to more attractions on control charts as one of the useful tools that contribute to the success in SM by anomaly detection (AD) approach. Coefficient of variation (CV) is a recent popular statistic that is used in the quality control of SM. In this paper, we propose investigating the performance of Cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts monitoring CV with a fast initial response (FIR) strategy. The chart parameters are also optimized according to the random shift size in a given interval with the proposed Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. The numerical results show that the performance of FIR CUSUM-γ2 charts are greater than the initial CUSUM-γ2 ones. An example in monitoring yarn quality at the spinning mill with the design of FIR CUSUM-γ2 charts is also proposed. These findings are useful for practitioners as well as managers and researchers. The proposed design of FIR CUSUM-γ2 charts could be applied in other processes of various domains such as finance, business, industrial processes, etc. © 2022 The Authors.

Teterboro Airport, Box 2000, South Hackensack, 07606, NJ, United States","Demand forecast accuracy in the service supply chains e.g. spare parts is critical for customer satisfaction and its financial performance. This is a typical logistic network which is affected by irregular demand resulting from contract and non-contract business strategies. Hence, existing forecasting methods that work excellent with smooth and linear demand patterns become less accurate with increasing erratic, lumpy and intermittent demands. Moreover, increasing number of stock keeping units (SKUs) in service supply chains have computational limitations. This is because of the fact that demand keep on fluctuating their demand classes that result in uncertainty and consequently, leads to higher target stock levels (TSL) and lower reorder point (ROP) to ensure higher customer satisfaction. This raises interest in using AI for service supply chains to improve demand forecast accuracy. In this paper, we present a survey of existing forecasting methods used in service and non-service supply chains to select best performing AI methods and performance measures, using ABC classification. Neural network (NN) and Mean Square Error (MSE), are subsequently modelled and used in aircraft spare parts supply chain using data collected from Dassault Aviation, as a function of most commonly used aggregated demand features. The results are compared with frequently and best performing forecast methods for intermittent demand as Croston, Croston SBJ and Croston TSB; and classical methods as moving average (MA) and single exponential smoothening (SES).

Network administrators and vendors are now moving beyond conventional Intrusion-Detection Systems (IDS), that only identify problems after they have occurred, to a novel, constructive approach termed Artificial Intelligence (AI) based intrusion detection system. Conventional network Intrusion Detection Systems and firewalls are usually preconfigured to spot malicious network attacks. Now-a-days attackers have become profounder and can try evading common detection rules. There are a few targeted areas where Artificial Intelligence will distribute the extreme evolution for Cybersecurity. To design a proactive defence mechanism, the system has to understand the intelligence of threats that are currently targeting the organization. The implementation of Machine Learning (ML) and threat intelligent-based solutions into blend can revolutionize the landscape in cyber security industry against any kinds of network attacks. Machine Learning is an application of AI that uses a system which is capable of learning from experience. Even in the era of extremely large amount of data and cybersecurity skill shortage, ML can aid in solving the most common tasks including regression, prediction, and classification. In this chapter, the origin and evolution of IDS has been described, followed by the classification of IDS. This chapter will provide a truly interactive learning experience to help and prepare the researchers for the challenges in traditional IDS and the contributions of ML in IDS. This comprehensive review briefs the prominent current works, and an outline of the datasets frequently used for evaluation purpose. Moreover, this chapter will also describe the Collaborative Intrusion Detection that enhances the Big Data Security. Finally, it presents the IDS research issues and challenges; and the skills that need to survive and thrive in today’s threat-ridden and target-rich cyber environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attributes; Dataset; Intrusion detection system; Machine learning; Network traffic","","","","","","","","Mukherjee B., Heberlein L.T., Levitt K.N., Network intrusion detection, IEEE Netw, 8, 3, pp. 26-41, (2002); Chaturvedi P., A Systematic Literature Survey on IDS, pp. 671-676; Cheng T.H., Lin Y.D., Lai Y.C., Lin P.C., Evasion techniques: Sneaking through your intrusion detection/prevention systems, IEEE Commun.

The interest of this framework is also that it offers a generic and simple way for the modeling of real world applications. Nevertheless these applications call for tasks that often differ from a classical search for a solution. The aim of the present paper is not to provide the AI community with new and efficient algorithms, but with new requests and more generally new needs. All of them are issued from the analysis of the business needs that arise around the design and exploitation of the vehicle range at Renault, the French car manufacturer. Viewing this application as a fruitful source of research problematics for the community, we present a formalization and a theoretical study, in terms on complexity, of the series of requests risen by the application. © 2010 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Automobile manufacture; Business needs; Car manufacturers; Constraint Satisfaction; Constraint-based; Efficient algorithm; Real-world application; Renault; Theoretical study; Vehicle configuration; Algorithms","","","","","","","Aldanondo M., Fargier H., Veron M., From csp to configuration problems, Proceedings of AAAI-1999 Workshop on Configuration, pp. 101-106, (1999); Amilhastre J., Fargier H., Marquis P., Consistency restoration and explanations in dynamic CSP - Application to configuration, Artificial Intelligence, 135, 1-2, pp. 199-234, (2002); Bakker R.R., Dikker F., Tempelman F., Wognum P.M., Diagnosing and solving over-determined constraint satisfaction problems, Proceedings of IJCAI'93, pp. 276-281, (1993); Chmeiss A., Krawczyk V., Sais L., Redundancy in csps, Proceedings of ECAI'08, pp. 907-908, (2008); Cooper M.C., Schiex T., Arc consistency for soft constraints, Artificial Intelligence, 154, 1-2, pp. 199-227, (2004); De Kleer J., Problem solving with the atms, Artificial Intelligence, 28, 2, pp. 197-224, (1986); De Siqueira J.L., Puget J.-F., Explanation-based generalisation of failures, Proceedings of ECAI'88, pp. 339-344, (1988); Felfernig A., Friedrich G., Jannach D., Stumptner M., Consistency-based diagnosis of configuration knowledge bases, Proceedings of ECAI'00, pp. 146-150, (2000); Fleischanderl G., Friedrich G., Haselbock A., Schreiner H., Stumptner M., Configuring large-scale systems with generative constraint satisfaction, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Special Issue on Configuration, 13, 4, (1998); Gelle E., Weigel R., Interactive configuration using constraint satisfaction techniques, Proceedings of PACT-96, pp. 37-44, (1996); Gent I.P., Arc consistency in sat, Proceedings of ECAI'02, pp. 121-125, (2002); Junker U., Mailharro D., The logic of ilog (j)configurator: Combining constraint programming with a description logic, Proceedings of IJCAI-03 Workshop on Configuration, pp. 13-20, (2003); Junker U., Mailharro D., Preference programming: Advanced problem solving for configuration, AI EDAM, 17, 1, pp. 13-29, (2003); Mittal S., Falkenhainer B., Dynamic constraint satisfaction problems, Proceedings of AAAI'90, pp. 25-32, (1990); Papadimitriou C.M., Computational Complexity, (1994); Pargamin B., Extending cluster tree compilation with non-boolean variables in product configuration, IJCAI'03 Workshop on Configuration, 2002; Pargamin B., Vehicle sales configuration: The cluster tree approach, ECAI'02 Workshop on Configuration, 2002; Sabin D., Freuder E.C., Configuration as composite constraint satisfaction, AI and Manufacturing Research Planning Workshop, pp. 153-161, (1996); Schiex T., Possibilistic constraint satisfaction problems or ""how to handle soft constraints?, Proceedings of UAI, pp. 268-275, (1992); Soininen T., Gelle E., Niemela I., A fixpoint definition of dynamic constraint satisfaction, Proceedings of CP'99, pp. 419-433, (1999); Stumptner M., Haselbock A., A generative constraint formalism for configuration problems, Proceedings of the Third Congress of the Italian Association for Artif.

Composing a service composition usually happens at design time, but this limit the choices of component services. This paper presents a framework for web service composition and execution based on the integration of different domains. Given a user's query, and a list of service descriptions (in SAWSDL), the framework first provides an automated composition of services based on Fluent Calculus. This step, employing chaining inference from AI-planning with FLUX constraint programming method, generates a plan which is either a sequence or a parallel composition of operations offered by the selected services. As a second step, the plan is transformed into a BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) model in order to be executed by any BPMN engine. The proposed work relies on a broad project that aims at design and develop a non intrusive framework dediated to context aware mobile services [1]-[3]. © 2014 IEEE.","AI-planning; automated service composition; FLUX agent; Web service","Application programs; Automation; Calculations; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Information management; Quality of service; Social networking (online); Software agents; Systems engineering; Websites; AI planning; Automated composition; Automated service composition; Business process modeling notations; Constraint programming; Context-aware mobile services; Parallel composition; Web service composition; Web services","","","","","","","Lumpoon P.N., Lei M., Kamnardsiri T., Fauvet M.-C., Lbath A., Et al., Illustrating some issues raised when designing context-aware personalized services for mobile users, 6th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA 2012), (2011); Lumpoon P.N., Lei M., Caicedo-Castro I., Fauvet M.-C., Lbath A., Et al., Context-aware service discovering system for nomad users, 7th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA), (2013); Lbath A., Method and device for automatic production of context aware mobile services, PATENTSCOPE.

However, it is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models, or if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex intrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we investigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons, such as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This model can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS), regular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the oscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks using such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with surprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show that the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust emergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we investigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks with strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is reduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical networks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but with strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state transitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by two-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic properties such as adaptation and low-threshold bursting activity are crucial for the genesis and control of AI states in thalamocortical networks. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Cerebral cortex; Computational models; Intrinsic neuronal properties; Network models; Thalamocortical system; Thalamus","Brain; Electrophysiology; Network layers; Cerebral cortex; Computational modelling; Cortical network; Intrinsic neuronal properties; Low thresholds; Network models; Spike frequency adaptations; Thalamo-cortical network; Thalamocortical system; Thalamus; adaptation; anesthesia; article; brain cortex; controlled study; excitatory postsynaptic potential; inhibitory postsynaptic potential; nerve cell network; neuromodulation; oscillation; priority journal; slow wave sleep; spike wave; thalamocortical tract; thalamus; Neurons","","","","","Future and Emerging Technologies program; European Commission, EC; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS","Acknowledgements Thanks to Sami El Boustani for comments on the manuscript.

With a network of 1.4 million km, it spends several hundred million Euros every year to maintain the existing network. Enedis is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to choose which parts of the network have to be renewed. The general approach of the targeting method presented in this paper was initially developed for underground Low Voltage (LV) networks and has been successfully used for three years. However, it could not be directly applied to the Medium Voltage (MV) network due to its different structure, with fewer but much longer feeders. MV network reliability is even more critical since faults on this network usually have a bigger impact on power supply. In order to fit some machine learning models on a portion of the network which has a size relevant for renewal investment, it has been necessary to develop complex data analytics, such as graph calculation, to get the useful features to train the models. The technologies used for data preparation allows the solution to be scaled up after successful tests on smaller dataset. We estimate that this new method applied over a three years period increases the number of faulty cables identified by 60%, compared to the current business as usual targeting method. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

The recent development and addition of a grating tuned spectroscopy laser to the TRIUMF RILIS solid state laser system allows for wide range spectral scans to investigate atomic structures on short lived isotopes, e. g., those from the element actinium, produced in uranium targets at ISAC. In addition, development of new and improved laser ionization schemes for rare isotope production at ISAC is ongoing. Here spectroscopic studies on bound states, Rydberg states and autoionizing (AI) resonances on scandium using the existing off-line capabilities are reported. These results allowed to identify a suitable ionization scheme for scandium via excitation into an autoionizing state at 58,104 cm-1 which has subsequently been used for ionization of on-line produced exotic scandium isotopes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Actinium; In-source spectroscopy; Resonance ionization; RILIS; Scandium","","","","","","Government of British Columbia provides building capital funds; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; National Research Council Canada, NRC","Acknowledgements TRIUMFs core operations are supported via a contribution from the federal government through the National Research Council Canada; the Government of British Columbia provides building capital funds.

AI has already been incorporated in many industries to improve business processes and automation. Although the aviation industry has successfully implemented flight management systems or autopilot to automate flight operations, it is expected that full embracement of AI remains a challenge. Given the rigorous validation process and the requirements for the highest level of safety standards and risk management, AI needs to prove itself being safe to operate. This paper addresses the safety issues of AI deployment in an aviation network compatible with the Future Communication Infrastructure that utilizes heterogeneous wireless access technologies for communications between the aircraft and the ground networks. It further considers the exploitation of software defined networking (SDN) technologies in the ground network while the adoption of SDN in the airborne network can be optional. Due to the nature of centralized management in SDN-based network, the SDN controller can become a single point of failure or a target for cyber attacks. To countermeasure such attacks, an intrusion detection system utilises AI techniques, more specifically deep neural network (DNN), is considered. However, an adversary can target the AI-based intrusion detection system. This paper examines the impact of AI security attacks on the performance of the DNN algorithm. Poisoning attacks targeting the DSL-KDD datasets which were used to train the DNN algorithm were launched at the intrusion detection system. Results showed that the performance of the DNN algorithm has been significantly degraded in terms of the mean square error, accuracy rate, precision rate and the recall rate. © 2020 IEEE.","AI security; Deep Neural Network; Heterogeneous wireless access technologies; Intrusion detection; SDN","Aircraft communication; Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Digital avionics; Intrusion detection; Mean square error; Modems; Network security; Risk management; Safety engineering; Centralized management; Communication infrastructure; Flight management systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Rigorous validation; Software defined networking (SDN); Wireless access technology; Wireless communications networks; Computer crime","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (892002)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors acknowledge the inspiration from CS2 Joint Undertaking (JU).

The entities involved should anticipate the consequences of future regulations and to some extent are already one step ahead. The assessment of AI technologies must be documented following a risk-based approach. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","algorithm; artificial intelligence; financial services; governance; RegTech; risk-based approach; SupTech","","","","","","","","","F.

In the one-dimensional case, we design a table-based algorithm that is computationally faster than alternative algorithms. In the two-dimensional case, we design an accept-reject algorithm. According to our calculations and numerical studies, the acceptance rate of this algorithm is bounded from below by 0.5 for semi-finite truncation intervals, and by 0.47 for finite intervals. Extension to three or more dimensions is discussed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Accept-reject; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Tail Gaussian distribution; Truncated Gaussian distribution","","","","","","","","Abramowitz M., Stegun I., Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Table, (1965); Ahrens J., Sampling from general distributions by suboptimal division of domains, Grazer Math.

AI can drive progress, development, and democratization governments properly handle the challenges. It can boost productivity growth by extending opportunities in crucial African development areas such as agriculture, healthcare, financial services, and public services. AI will enable employees, entrepreneurs, and enterprises to compete worldwide and be at the vanguard of economic development by providing access to high-quality digital tools. However, the roadblocks necessitate firm policy answers. AI will need significant changes for workers, employers, businesses and open new ethical questions that need thoughtful responses. Higher constraints specific to Africa, such as network limits, educational institution readiness, and the availability of digital data, exacerbate the ethical issues. Africa must make aggressive attempts to address its problems; however, if it succeeds, it will catch up to countries that have previously taken steps to improve AI. These efforts will be complicated, but the road ahead is clear. The government’s effectiveness will be determined by its capacity to facilitate collaboration among all stakeholders, including state and civil society, academics, industry, and national and international stakeholders. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Business Intelligence; Data protection; Open data","","","","","","","","Berrajaa A., Ettifouri E.H., The recurrent neural network for program synthesis, ICDTA 2021.

The challenges faced in this project include multiplayer collaboration in a shared, interactive and dynamically evolving virtual environment, and modelling educational scenarios on the basis of actual observations inside the operating room. The model we detail is grounded on a semantic definition of the environment which allowed for three innovative features. A game-mediated communication system where information pertaining to the game is exchanged in real time by the players. AI-controlled characters replacing missing players as fully equal partners.

In a competitive environment, one of the biggest problems that companies face is employee departure or «Employee Attrition». The automatic prediction of employee attrition has only recently begun to attract the attention of researchers in various industries, as it can predict employee departure and identify the factors that influence employees to change employers. Some AI platforms are developed in order to predict employee attrition, i.e. employees likely to change employer. The objective is to help companies anticipate departures to minimize financial losses due to employee attrition. However, these prediction systems are not generic and are specific to each company. In this context, we are interested in understanding the factors that influence an employee to leave his position. We aim to develop a generic attrition prediction platform that does not depend on the application domain, based on bipartite graph properties and machine learning algorithms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bipartite graph; Employee attrition; Machine learning","Forecasting; Graph theory; Learning algorithms; Losses; Personnel; Automatic prediction; Bipartite graphs; Competitive environment; Employee attrition; Employee departure; Financial loss; Human resource is; Machine-learning; New approaches; Prediction systems; Machine learning","","","","","","","Heppell N., Le Roulement Du Personnel Et La Performance Organisationnelle: l’effet modérateur Des Pratiques De Gestion Des Ressources Humaines, (2012); Dalton D.R., Todor W.D., Krackhardt D.M., Turnover overstated: The functional taxonomy, Acad.

Heuristics on predictive analytics are developed with novel applications to decision trees. Augmented world and priority-based decision trees are new applications for machine learning and big data filtering. The areas addressed include designing predictive modeling with strategic decision systems with applications to analytics, enterprise modeling, and cognitive social media business interfaces. The areas further explored range from plan goal decision tree satisfiability with competitive business models to predictive analytics models that accomplish goals on 3-tier glimpse to business systems.

For several years there had been many predictions about how artificial intelligence (AI) would change the way we work and how it would have a profound effect on every area of business. However, most of these speculations are not relying on empirical studies or real-life practice. From a business standpoint, AI is still seen as a very young technology with not enough return on experience.

An important side effect of these drugs is vaginal dryness for which local hormonal therapy (LHT) represents the most effective treatment but is theoretically contraindicated. This study aimed to assess whether the use of LHT increases the risk of breast cancer recurrence among women receiving endocrine treatment. We conducted a cohort study with nested case-control analysis using the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The cohort included female patients at least 18 years of age, newly diagnosed with breast cancer who received at least one AI or tamoxifen prescription between January 1, 1998 and June 30, 2008. Cases, who were patients experiencing a breast cancer recurrence during follow-up, were each matched with up to 10 controls based on age, date of cohort entry, type of endocrine treatment received, and duration of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate rate ratios (RR), and 95 % confidence intervals. A total of 13,479 women were included in the study, of which 2,673 received AIs, 10,806 received tamoxifen, and 271 received LHT. Mean (SD) age at cohort entry was 63.7 (14.1) years, and mean follow-up was 3.5 (2.6) years. The crude recurrence rate 25.9 per 1,000 per year. Overall, the use of LHT was not associated with an increased risk of recurrence (RR: 0.78, 95 % CI 0.48-1.25) compared with non-use. In stratified analyses, LHT did not increase the risk of recurrence among tamoxifen-treated patients (RR: 0.83, 95 % CI 0.51-1.34), while the risk was not estimable among AI-treated patients since no patients receiving LHT experienced a recurrence. The use of LHT is not associated with an increase in breast cancer recurrence among women receiving a hormone therapy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2012.","Estrogen receptor; Local hormonal therapy;

It will also contribute to global competitiveness of enterprises through enablement of fact-based decision-making and improved insight. The digitalisation process currently ongoing in industry, and the corresponding implementation of AI technologies, requires availability and accessibility of data and models. Data and models are considered as digital assets (ISO55K) that impact a system’s dependability during its whole lifecycle. Digitalisation and implementation of AI in complex technical systems such as found in railway, mining, and aerospace industries is challenging. From a digital asset management perspective, the main challenges can be related to source integration, content processing, and cybersecurity. However, to effectively and efficiently retain the required performance of a complex technical system during its lifecycle, there is a need of appropriate concepts, methodologies, and technologies. With this background, Luleå University of Technology, in cooperation with a number of Swedish railway stakeholders – fleet managers, railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), has created a universal platform called ‘the AI Factory’ (AIF). The concept of AIF has further been specialised for railway industry, so called AI Factory for Railway (AIF/R). Hence, this paper aims to provide a description of findings from the development and implementation of ‘AI Factory (AIF)’ in the railway context. Furthermore, the paper provides a case-study description used to verify the developed technologies and methodologies within AIF/R. © ESREL 2021.

Despite the fact that many people are accustomed to online shopping, e-commerce merchants are facing a significant problem, a high percentage of checkout abandonment. In this study, we have proposed an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) system that will assist the merchant to minimize the rate of checkout abandonment with proper decision making and strategy. As a part of the system, we developed a robust ML model that predicts if someone will checkout the products added to the cart based on the customer's activity. Our system also provides the merchants with the opportunity to explore the underlying reasons for each single prediction output.

Those structures are described, using six invariants: group, the size of fundamental domain, mean coordination number f , fraction sequence, cell orbits and major skeleton. We found pairs of distinct structures having all six invariants equal. So, we devised a new invariant, zigzag vector, and computed it for all 135 structures known from now; all have this invariant different. New bounds for f and new directions (computational perspectives, number of Kekule structures, space octahedrites, space cubites) are also discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","E3-tilings; Enumeration; Frank-Kasper structures","","","","","","Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI; Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA; Ministarstvo Znanosti, Obrazovanja i Sporta, MZOS, (098-0982705-2707)","Acknowledgments First author has been supported by the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sport under contract 098-0982705-2707.

The role of ML-based 6G techniques is to reshape the imaginary idea into physical world for resolving the challenging issues of energy, quality of service (QoS), and quality of experience (QoE). Besides, ML techniques with better association to 6G reshapes the industrial network in box (NIB) platform. In the mean-time rapidly increasing market of the IoT devices to deliver multimedia content has caught the attention of various fields such as, industrial, and healthcare. The challenging issue that end-users are facing is the unsatisfactory and annoyed performance of portable devices while surfing the video, and image to/from desired entity, i.e., low QoE. To resolve these issues this research first, proposes a novel ML-driven mobility management method for the efficient communication in industrial NIB applications. Second, a novel architecture of 6G-based intelligent QoE and QoS optimization in industrial NIB is proposed. Third, a 6G-based NIB framework is proposed in association to the long-term evolution. Forth, use-case for 6G-empowered industrial NIB is recommended for an energy efficient communication. Experimental results are extracted with high energy efficiency, better QoE, and QoS in 6G-based industrial NIB.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); industrial network in box (NIB); quality of experience (QoE); quality of service (QoS)","Advanced Analytics; Data Analytics; Industrial research; Internet of things; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Quality of service; Computing capability; Efficient communications; Energy efficient communications; High energy efficiency; Industrial networks; Internet of Things (IOT); Mobility management methods; Quality of experience (QoE); Energy efficiency","","","","","","","Cap H., Wu S., Dynamic embedding & qos-driven adjustment for cloud networks, IEEE Trans.

It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI's association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Cultural drift; Knowledge Management System (KMS); Machine learning sustainability; Sustainable business models","","","","","","Department of Law, (002158); Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, UNINA","This research has been funded by Department of Law, number 002158, University of Naples “Parthenope” (Italy).

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); business models; cyber physical systems (CPSs); digital twin (DT); Internet of Things (IoT); machine learning (ML); multiagent systems; network function virtualization; sensors; servitization; smart city; software architecture; softwarization; virtual and augmented reality","Internet of things; Multi agent systems; Surveys; Application contexts; Application scenario; Architectural modeling; Architectural models; Augmented and virtual realities; Essential characteristic; Manufacturing industries; Software architecture model; Digital twin","","","","","","","Grieves M., Product Lifecycle Management: Driving the Next Generation of Lean Thinking, (2006); Haag S., Anderl R., Digital twin-Proof of concept, Manuf.

However, despite this observation, few fine-grained analyses have been carried out into the in situ communicative strategies deployed by practitioners to deal with the face-threatening nature of AIs. Using conversation analysis as a research methodology and transcripts of naturally occurring talk from an AI, this article explicates the seen but unnoticed machinery of talk by which facework during AIs is accomplished.

This approach is part of a global project of implementing a strategic intelligence device based on four pillars, namely: strategic watch, Knowledge Management, influence and lobbying techniques and protection and information security. The materialization of this project has gone through the realization of a study aiming three main objectives: (1) studying the monitoring practices within the OCP Group; (2) identifying and studying the needs of decision makers concerning strategic information; (3) propose a capitalization approach for information's resulting from the strategic watch activities of the group in order to better position it in an increasingly competitive market. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a survey with the managers of the monitoring activities within the Group to better understand this activity and identify their needs and target our proposal. This project is the first national experiment in Morocco to develop ontology in the field of phosphates that can inspire other works in other sectors of activity. In this article, we will first present the context of the research. Then, we will dedicate a part of it for defining the main concepts mobilized in our research namely, strategic intelligence and ontologies. Finally, the process of designing and implementing the ontology. Although related since its appearance in the field of philosoph (Univesalis encyclopedia), the notion of ontology is considered in this article from an Artificial Intelligence (AI) angle. © 2018 IEEE.","business intelligence; knowledge management; ontologies; strategic intelligence","Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Ontology; Phosphates; Security of data; Watches; Competitive markets; Decision makers; Global projects; Monitoring activities; Strategic intelligence; Knowledge management","","","","","","","Lesca H., Veille Stratégique: Concepts et Démarches de Mise en Place dans l'Entreprise, (1997); Management de l'Intelligence Stratégique, (2012); (2001); Définition de l'Intelligence Stratégique Selon l'Agence de Stimulation Economique., (2014); Lepere C., Marcoux J.C., Small Business Intelligence, (2011); Intelligence Économique: Un Guide pour Débutants et Praticiens., (2002); (2018); Guarino N., Giaretta P., Ontologies and knowledge bases: Towards a terminological clarification, Towards Very Large Knowledge Bases: Knowledge Building and Knowledge Sharing, pp. 25-32, (1995); Gruber T.R., Toward principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge sharing, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, pp. 907-928, (1995); Studer R., Benjamins V.R., Fensel D., Knowledge engineering: Principles and methods, Data & Knowledge Engineering, pp. 161-197, (1998); Gandon F., Graphes RDF et Leur Manipulation pour la Gestion de Connaissances, pp. 45-50, (2008); Gruber T.R., A translation approach to portable ontology specifications, Knowledge Acquisition, pp. 199-220, (1993); Hernandez N., Ontologies de Domaine pour la Modélisation de Contexte en Recherche d'Information, (2005)","","Al Achhab M.; El Mohajir M.; Jellouli I.; El Mohajir B.E.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Morocco Computer and Communication Joint Chapter; IEEE Morocco Section","5th International Congress on Information Science and Technology, CiSt 2018","22 October 2018 through 24 October 2018","Marrakech","144145","2327185X","978-153864385-3","","","English","Colloq.

Enaction is considered a metaphor for artificial intelligence, as a number of the notions which it deals with are deemed incompatible with the phenomenal field of the virtual. After explaining this stance, we shall review previous works regarding this issue in terms of artificial life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of co-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly integrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine the ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction paradigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated can therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from the environment. This proposition does not however, resolve that of the relevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such reflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in order to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial intelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an enactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues, thereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of morphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of minimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the problem of artificial intelligence in a variety of enaction-based ways. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Co-evolution; Embodied-embedded AI; Enaction; Guidance; Human in the loop; Phylogenesis/ontogenesis ratio; Sense-making; Virtual reality","Artificial intelligence; Virtual reality; Co-evolution; Enaction; Guidance; Human-in-the-loop; Sensemaking; Biology","","","","","","","Ashby W., Design for A Brain: The Origin of Adaptive Behavior, (1960); Aubin J., Viability Theory, (1991); Auvray M., Hanneton S., Lenay C., O'Regan K., There is something out there: Distal attributtion in sensory substitution, twenty years later, Journal of Integrative Neuroscience, 4, 4, pp. 505-521, (2005); Beer R.D., Dynamical approaches to cognitive science, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, 3, pp. 91-99, (2000); Beer R., Autopoiesis and cognition in the game of life, Artificial Life, 10, 3, pp. 309-326, (2004); Beer R., Gallagher J., Evolving dynamical neural networks for adaptive behavior, Adaptive Behavior, 1, 1, pp. 91-122, (1992); Bersini H., Sener P., Le chaos dans les rseaux de neurons, Approche Dynamique de la Cognition Artificielle, pp. 45-58, (2002); Beurier G., Michel F., Ferber J., A morphogenesis model for multiagent embryogeny, Artificial Life X, Proceedings of the 10th International Conference, (2006); Beurier G., Simonin O., Ferber J., Model and simulation of multimodel emergence, Procedings of IEEE ISSPIT, pp. 231-236, (2002); Bickhard M.H., The biological emergence of representation, Emergence and Reduction: Proceedings of the 29th Annual Symposium of the Jean Piaget Society, pp. 105-131, (2003); Bourgine P., Stewart J., Autopoiesis and cognition, Artificial Life, 10, pp. 327-345, (2004); Brogni A., Vinayagamoorthy V., Steed A., Slater M., Responses of participants during an immersive virtual environment experience, The International Journal of Virtual Reality, 6, 2, pp. 1-10, (2007); Brooks R., Intelligence without representation, Artificial Intelligence, 47, pp. 139-159, (1991); Butz M.V., Goldberg D.E., Stolzmann W., Investigating generalization in the anticipatory classifier system, Proceedings of Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN VI), (2000); Chalmer D., Facing up to the problem of consciousness, Journal of Consciousness Studies, 2, pp. 200-219, (1995); Chandrasekharan S., Stewart T.C., The origin of epistemic structures and proto-representations, Adaptive Behavior, 15, 3, pp. 329-353, (2007); Clark A., An embodied cognitive science?, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 3, 9, pp. 345-351, (1999); Dauce E., Systèmes dynamiques pour les sciences cognitives, Approche Dynamique de la Cognition Artificielle, pp. 33-44, (2002); Dauce E., Quoy M., Cessac B., Doyon B., Samuelides M., Self-organization and dynamics reduction in recurrent networks: Stimulus presentation and learning, Neural Networks, 11, 3, pp. 521-533, (1998); De Jaegher H., Di Paolo E., Participatory sense-making an enactive approach to social cognition, Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences, 6, 4, pp. 485-507, (2007); De Loor P., Benard R., Bossard C., Interactive co-construction to study dynamical collaborative situations, To Appear in the Proceedings in the International Conference on Virtual Reality, (2008); Dellaert F., Beer R., Toward an evolvable model of development for autonomous agent synthesis, Artificial Life IV, Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems, pp. 246-257, (1994); Dempster B., Sympoietic and autopoietic systems: A new distinction for self-organizing systems, Proceedings of the World Congress of the Systems Sciences and ISSS 2000, pp. 1-18, (2000); Desmeulles G., Querrec G., Redou P., Kerdlo S., Misery L., Rodin V., Tisseau J., The virtual reality applied to the biology understanding: The in virtuo experimentation, Expert Systems with Applications, 30, 1, pp. 82-92, (2006); Di Paolo E., Homeostatic adaptation to inversion in the visual field and other sensorimotor disruptions, From Animals to Animats 6.

Therefore, doing justice to the Imitation Game implies showing first, that the formalist interpretation misses some crucial points in Turing's line of thought and second, that the 1950 paper should not be understood as the Magna Chartaof strong Artificial Intelligence (AI) but as a work in progressfocused on the notion of Form.

IoT technologies are exploited to enhance productivity in aquaculture sites by maintaining precise operating conditions and to avoid undesirable situations. Currently, human intervention is still needed to make good decisions, dependant on the values of parameters detected by sensors, often captured at one point in time in a day. This is not only a time-consuming task but also an inaccurate one since parameters, such as water quality, evolves continuously and affects the whole aquaculture system. This is mainly caused by the lack of information collection, exchange and process automation between different actors in aquaculture farms. To overcome these problems, technologies such as semantic Web technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI), are bringing new capabilities to organise data in an inter-operable way to then be processed and used for monitoring and decision-making. In this context, we are proposing in this paper a fully semantic based-reference data model for Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) that involves the collection, processing, and sharing of data both between components and between the platform and external aqua-systems by supporting IoT and data information standards. It is based on analysis of the current data models and covers the core concepts required for aquaculture management and has been validated against several business scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.","Aquaculture; Interoperability; IoT; Semantics","Aquaculture; Decision making; Interoperability; Semantics; Water quality; Aquaculture management; Aquaculture systems; Information collections; Internet of Things (IOT); Operating condition; Reference data models; Semantic Web technology; Time-consuming tasks; Internet of things","","","","","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (774109); European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: The research leading to these results has been supported by the IMPAQT project, which receives funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under grant agreement No. 774109.

Unfortunately, in the context of new generation ""Big Data""warehouses, these approaches are not correctly adapted to Business Intelligence 2.0, where the analyst is at the heart of decision support systems. This ""disconnect""situation strongly impacts both data partitioning and fragment allocation processes, which are essential to achieve good query performance. To overcome this problem, recent studies proposed online data partitioning and fragment allocation using AI techniques to improve query performance with adaptive behavior. Nevertheless, they have important limitations: they add significant overhead and they tend to focus on the current workload, ignoring query logs. With such motivation in mind, we first formulate the problem of optimizing database partitioning subject to feasibility constraints, based on a query workload. We then introduce a proactive partitioning approach combining offline and online processing phases, inspired by closed-loop control (used in engineering disciplines) and genetic algorithms (from AI). We present an experimental validation on a big data cluster that shows promising results on typical OLAP workloads. © 2020 IEEE.","","Big data; Closed loop control systems; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Genetic algorithms; Information retrieval; Query processing; Allocation process; Business intelligence 2.0; Closed-loop control; Database partitioning; Engineering disciplines; Experimental validations; Genetic optimization; Parallel database systems; Data handling","","","","","","","Agrawal S., Narasayya V.R., Yang B., Integrating vertical and horizontal partitioning into automated physical database design, Acm Sigmod, pp. 359-370, (2004); Curino C., Jones E., Zhang Y., Madden S., Schism: A workloaddriven approach to database replication and partitioning, Proc.

This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation","","","","","","","","Abijith A., Wamba S.F., Business value of RFID-enabled healthcare transformation projects, Business Process Management Journal, 19, 1, (2012); Barney J., Wright M., Ketchen D.J., The resource-based view of the firm: ten years after 1991, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 625-641, (2001); Benko A., Lanyi C.S., History of artificial intelligence, Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, pp. 1759-1762, (2009); Benner M.J., Dynamic or static capabilities?

Box 2223, Egypt","Highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) due to H5N1 virus was first reported in Egypt in February 2006; since then, the government has allowed avian influenza vaccination in poultry. The present study evaluated the impact of AI vaccination in terms of cumulative annual flock immunity (CAFI): the percentage of bird × weeks protected by immunity. This evaluation took account of the combined effects of vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacy (VE), and different characteristics of household poultry production on the effectiveness of the adopted vaccination strategy (VS), and provided alternative options for improvement. The evaluation used a population and vaccinationmodel that calculates the CAFI. Participatory approaches were employed in 21 villages to develop the vaccination and flock parameters required for the model. The adopted VS were compared in the model with three alternative VS scenarios in terms of the CAFI. Vaccination coverage varied among villages but was generally low (between 1 and 48 %; median 14 %). Under the adopted VS, the CAFI predicted for the villages ranged from 2 to 31 %. It was concluded that despite the enormous effort put into rural household poultry AI vaccination by the Egyptian government, village CAFI is unlikely to be maintained at the levels required to significantly reduce the virus load and restrict transmission. In HPAI-endemic countries that consider AI vaccination as one of the disease control options, the high cost of mass AI vaccination campaigns and their achievable benefits must be compared with other available control measures, which may include targeted vaccination. Achievable vaccination coverage, VE and the different characteristics of commercial and household (village) poultry production are key parameters determining the feasibility and costeffectiveness of different AI vaccination strategies. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Avian influenza; Egypt; Flockimmunity; HPAI H5N1; Vaccination coverage; Vaccination strategy","Animal Husbandry; Animals; Egypt; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza Vaccines; Mass Vaccination; Models, Biological; Poultry; Poultry Diseases; Vaccination; Aves; influenza vaccine; animal; animal disease; animal husbandry; article; avian influenza; biological model; bird disease; Egypt; immunology; Influenza virus A H5N1; mass immunization; poultry; vaccination; virology","","","","","FAO, (OSRO/EGY/701/USA); United States Agency for International Development, USAID","Acknowledgements The authors would like to express their gratitude to the staff of the veterinary services; Dr. Rob de Rooij (former ECTAD Team Leader), Mr. Toni Ettel (ECTAD/EGY Programs Operation Officer) and Dr. Tony Wilsmore and Dr. Paolo Pagani (FAO Consultants) for their support during the field study.
