Following completion of our multicentre randomised controlled trial, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to reflect on our experiences and share our thoughts on challenges, lessons learned, and recommendations for researchers undertaking or considering research in primary care. Methods: Researchers involved in the Prediction of Undiagnosed atriaL fibrillation using a machinE learning AlgorIthm (PULsE-AI) trial, conducted in England from June 2019 to February 2021 were invited to participate in a qualitative reflection exercise. Members of the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) were invited to attend a semi-structured focus group session, Principal Investigators and their research teams at practices involved in the trial were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Following transcription, reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken based on pre-specified themes of recruitment, challenges, lessons learned, and recommendations that formed the structure of the focus group/interview sessions, whilst also allowing the exploration of new themes that emerged from the data. Results: Eight of 14 members of the TSC, and one of six practices involved in the trial participated in the reflection exercise. Recruitment was highlighted as a major challenge encountered by trial researchers, even prior to disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers also commented on themes such as the need to consider incentivisation, and challenges associated with using technology in trials, especially in older age groups. Conclusions: Undertaking a formal reflection exercise following the completion of the PULsE-AI trial enabled us to review experiences encountered whilst undertaking a prospective randomised trial in primary care. In sharing our learnings, we hope to support other clinicians undertaking research in primary care to ensure that future trials are of optimal value for furthering knowledge, streamlining pathways, and benefitting patients. © 2023, The Author(s).","Primary care; Qualitative research; Randomised controlled trial; Recruitment; Reflection exercise","Aged; Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Prospective Studies; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; aged; artificial intelligence; clinical trial; coronavirus disease 2019; human; multicenter study; pandemic; primary health care; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic)","","","","","Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Ltd & Pfizer Inc; Pfizer; National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR","Funding text 1: This work was funded by Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Ltd & Pfizer Inc.

Informed by the literature of customer decision-making process, we propose and show that consumer autonomy is a significant predictor of customers' decision to adopt AI in the purchasing context. Across three experiments, we found that the delegation of purchasing tasks to AI, which restricts choice and decision dimensions of consumers' perceived autonomy, reduces the likelihood of AI adoption. Our results show that the effects of choice and decision autonomy on AI adoption holds even when product choice evaluation is complex. We also found that identity-relevant consumption moderates this relationship, such that it interacts with choice and decision autonomy. Specifically, despite lacking choice and decision autonomy, those who identify strongly with a given activity are more likely to use an AI-enabled app to purchase the product needed to perform this activity. With these insights into when and why consumers are likely to use AI-enabled technology, firms might effectively increase its adoption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","AI; AI adoption; AI aversion; Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Choice; Consumer decision-making process; Decision","Decision making; Sales; Artificial intelligence adoption; Artificial intelligence aversion; Autonomy; Choice; Consumer decision making; Consumer decision-making process; Customer decisions; Decision; Decision autonomies; Decision-making process; Artificial intelligence","","","","","NEOMA Business School","The work received financial grant from the AI, Data Science & Business Area of Excellence (Users' Experience of AI; Grant No. 416407 ), NEOMA Business School .

More specifically the human influencers' era? Indeed, AI-powered digital avatars called “virtual influencers” are replacing them as marketing influence partners with the biggest brands, such as Prada, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton.

This research aims to understand the incredible popularity of certain virtual influencers among consumers as well as their limits. This article explores this emerging phenomenon using a mixed qualitative methodology combining three retail case studies in Brazil and 16 experts open-ended interviews with. The results show that: (1) not being human is advantageous to virtual influencers; (2) their story is more important than their appearance in creating engagement; (3) they contribute to improve digital marketing campaigns; and (4) they seem more authentic than human influencers. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Digital influencers; Influencer marketing; Social media; Storytelling; Virtual influencers","Brazil; Commerce; Virtual reality; Case-studies; Digital influencer; Digital marketing; Influence marketing; Marketing campaign; Qualitative methodologies; Social media; Storytelling; Virtual influencer; artificial intelligence; marketing; qualitative analysis; retailing; social media; virtual reality; Marketing","","","","","","","Abdel-Basset M., Chang V., Nabeeh N.A., An intelligent framework using disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis, Technol.

This allows infrastructure and service providers to better deploy, configure and automate their traffic management policies and network equipments. However, congestion control remains a concern due to the evolution of increasingly complex and resource-intensive user requirements [(virtual reality, metaverse, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud,..] on network infrastructures. This server state leads to high latency in request processing and data loss. This paper proposes, in such a controller-supervised environment, a congestion management scheme within network service servers to maintain an acceptable quality of service. The strategy relies on work stealing to ensure a better workload balance. Simulations show that the proposed solution can reduce congestion load on the servers by up to 22%, depending on the request grain size, with shorter latency than other works in the literature. Moreover, the proposed solution allows stolen tasks to be completed within a shorter time frame. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Congestion control; Quality of service; SDN; Task scheduling; Work stealing","Data handling; Internet of things; Quality control; Virtual reality; Congestion control; Congestions managements; Large-scale network; Management scheme; Network infrastructure; Programmable network; Quality-of-service; Software-defined networkings; Tasks scheduling; Work stealing; Quality of service","","","","","","","Zhou Y., Ren B., Xie J., Luo L., Guo D., Zhou X., Enable the proactively load-balanced control plane for SDN via intelligent switch-to-controller selection strategy, Comput.

However, many organizations grapple with implementing AI solutions due to a lack of necessary infrastructure and mechanisms. In short, many companies are not adequately prepared to adopt AI. To make matters worse, the literature does not offer sufficient insights into this issue. To help address this issue, in this article, the authors explore what it means to become ‘AI-ready.’ Specifically, this study identifies the various dimensions of AI readiness through in-depth semi-structured interviews with top- and middle-level managers from 52 multinational corporations in Southeast Asia, primarily in India. This study employed a qualitative data analysis approach to construct a grounded theory model focusing on AI readiness. The methodology involved systematic examination and coding of data to identify key themes and patterns, enabling the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework. The findings suggest that AI readiness can be categorized into eight dimensions: informational, environmental, infrastructural, participants, process, customers, data, and technological readiness. This study makes a significant contribution to marketing, management, and information systems by conceptualizing the AI readiness construct and identifying its key dimensions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","AI adoption strategies; AI readiness; Artificial intelligence; Multinational corporations; Work system framework","Information management; Artificial intelligence adoption strategy; Artificial intelligence readiness; Customer values; In-depth analysis; Key dimensions; Multi-national corporations; Semi structured interviews; System framework; Work system; Work system framework; Artificial intelligence","","","","","University of Western Australia, UWA","This work was supported by the University of Western Australia .","Agerfalk P.J., Artificial intelligence as digital agency, Eur.

This new era will provide ubiquitous connection of up to billions of devices that are estimated to generate vast amounts of data, paving the way towards a data-driven network system design. In such network design, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will act as a key enabler with regard to network system automation and optimizations. One of the biggest challenges for AI in such complex and dynamic network environments, is the interoperability in terms of seamless exchange and analysis of information between two or more systems. Technological interoperability requires that the format in which data is generated or stored is standardized and that interconnected systems are aware of the nature of transmitted information and are able to analyze it. This paper proposes a novel, comprehensive Information Model (IM), named as SIM+, that extends all across the network, describing different network entities, attributes, capabilities and operations in an implementation-agnostic and standardized way towards assisting AI-driven optimizations. Seven key abstraction layers have been identified in an attempt to hide infrastructure complexities. The adaptability of the proposed SIM+ is showcased through its application in two state-of-the-art AI-driven solutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","AI; Beyond 5G networks; Context-aware networks; Implementation-agnostic information model; IOC; VNF","Abstracting; Information theory; Interoperability; Queueing networks; Beyond 5g network; Context-Aware; Context-aware network; Data driven; Implementation-agnostic information model; Information Modeling; IOC; Network systems; Optimisations; VNF; 5G mobile communication systems","","","","","","","Sharma S.K., Woungang I., Anpalagan A., Chatzinotas S., Toward tactile internet in beyond 5G era: Recent advances, current issues, and future directions, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 56948-56991, (2020); Moussaoui M., Bertin E., Crespi N., 5G shortcomings and beyond-5G/6G requirements, 2022 1st International Conference on 6G Networking, 6GNet, pp. 1-8, (2022); Jiang W., Han B., Habibi M.A., Schotten H.D., The road towards 6G: A comprehensive survey, IEEE Open J.

However, traditional methods are time-consuming, expensive, and complex. And existing mineral identification methods based on mineral photos face several critical challenges, including lack of consideration for natural image features captured in real environments, limitations of single-label classification which does not align with multi-mineral occurrences in nature, and growing computational complexity as the number of identifiable mineral labels increases. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient mineral identification model based on multi-label image classification, focusing on natural environmental features. First, realistic feature datasets are created by simulating mineral photos in real environments. Then, the model uses the query-label (Query2Label) framework, with MaxViT-T (Multi-Axis Vision Transformer-Tiny) as the feature extraction network and the asymmetric loss function. Knowledge distillation is employed to improve identification accuracy while reducing computational complexity. The proposed model achieves an impressive average identification accuracy of 84.74% on a dataset of 495,756 mineral photos, surpassing existing models like ResNet-101, ML-GCN (Multi-Label Graph Convolutional Network), and SRN (Spatial Regularization Net). It maintains a lower parameter count and computational complexity. In the end, ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each optimization scheme. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Data enhancement; Image multi-label classification; Mineral identification; Neural networks","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Computational complexity; Distillation; Image enhancement; Industrial research; Minerals; Data enhancement; Identification accuracy; Image multi-label classification; Images classification; Label images; Mineral identification; Multi-label classifications; Multi-labels; Neural-networks; Real environments; Image classification","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62002332, 62072443)","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments which greatly contributed to the improvement of the final version of the paper.

In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI, and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities. © 2023 The Authors","Co-benefits;

MV has evolved significantly since its inception over 70 years ago and the future promises even more advanced technology. In the past, ventilation was provided manually, intermittently, and it was primarily used for resuscitation or as a last resort for patients with severe respiratory or cardiovascular failure. The earliest MV machines for prolonged ventilatory support and oxygenation were large and cumbersome. They required a significant amount of skills and expertise to operate. These early devices had limited capabilities, battery, power, safety features, alarms, and therefore these often caused harm to patients. Moreover, the physiology of MV was modified when mechanical ventilators moved from negative pressure to positive pressure mechanisms. Monitoring systems were also very limited and therefore the risks related to MV support were difficult to quantify, predict and timely detect for individual patients who were necessarily young with few comorbidities. Technology and devices designed to use tracheostomies versus endotracheal intubation evolved in the last century too and these are currently much more reliable. In the present, positive pressure MV is more sophisticated and widely used for extensive period of time. Modern ventilators use mostly positive pressure systems and are much smaller, more portable than their predecessors, and they are much easier to operate. They can also be programmed to provide different levels of support based on evolving physiological concepts allowing lung-protective ventilation. Monitoring systems are more sophisticated and knowledge related to the physiology of MV is improved. Patients are also more complex and elderly compared to the past. MV experts are informed about risks related to prolonged or aggressive ventilation modalities and settings. One of the most significant advances in MV has been protective lung ventilation, diaphragm protective ventilation including noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Health care professionals are familiar with the use of MV and in many countries, respiratory therapists have been trained for the exclusive purpose of providing safe and professional respiratory support to critically ill patients. Analgo-sedation drugs and techniques are improved, and more sedative drugs are available and this has an impact on recovery, weaning, and overall patients' outcome. Looking toward the future, MV is likely to continue to evolve and improve alongside monitoring techniques and sedatives. There is increasing precision in monitoring global ""patient-ventilator"" interactions: structure and analysis (asynchrony, desynchrony, etc). One area of development is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in ventilator technology. AI can be used to monitor patients in real-time, and it can predict when a patient is likely to experience respiratory distress. This allows medical professionals to intervene before a crisis occurs, improving patient outcomes and reducing the need for emergency intervention. This specific area of development is intended as ""personalized ventilation."" It involves tailoring the ventilator settings to the individual patient, based on their physiology and the specific condition they are being treated for. This approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes by optimizing ventilation and reducing the risk of harm. In conclusion, MV has come a long way since its inception, and it continues to play a critical role in anesthesia and in CCM settings. Advances in technology have made MV safer, more effective, affordable, and more widely available. As technology continues to improve, more advanced and personalized MV will become available, leading to better patients' outcomes and quality of life for those in need. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.
