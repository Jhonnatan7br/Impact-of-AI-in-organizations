# Evolution of technology perception and industries' adoption

How could machine learning and AI impact organizations?
This question is particularly pertinent in modern business management research, as it delves into a critical aspect of organizational dynamics in the face of advancing technologies. 

I've chosen to focus on the impact of machine learning and AI tools because they've already begun to reshape how work is organized within organizations, whether through the automation of routine tasks, augmentation of decision-making processes, or the emergence of entirely new roles and responsibilities centered around AI integration.

# Vader sentiment Analysis Heuristics

The sentiment analysis results were statistically analyzed using Scipy and Scikit-Learn libraries.
This involved calculating average sentiment scores across different topics and keyword clusters,
allowing for the identification of trends in how AI research is perceived across various
organizational contexts. (Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Pedregosa et al. 2011) The
statistical insights were supplemented with qualitative observations derived from the manual
extraction of key concepts, adding depth to the interpretation of the data.

#  Insights into Research Themes and Organizational Perception

The bar chart showed on Figure 3 illustrates the sentiment score of research related to AI and
machine learning from 1985 to 2023. The y-axis represents the average sentiment, with values
ranging from 0 to 0.7, while the x-axis shows the years. Each bar corresponds to a specific year,
with the sentiment score labeled at the top of each bar.

This distribution reinforces the positive perception identified earlier, where AI and machine
learning research, particularly in high-growth sectors like technology, transportation, and
science, has increasingly been seen as favorable. (Curry et al. 2021). The clustering of sentiment
around higher values suggests that organizations view these technologies as beneficial to
operational efficiency, innovation, and strategic planning. The significant frequency of neutral
sentiment scores aligns with the scientific rigor and objectivity often found in research
documents, where results are presented with caution and without emotional bias.

### Topics modeling and Table

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef1e1dd-a956-45f1-920b-2fc7289f4817)

The table and topic modeling presents a series of topics, each represented by the top keywords that define its
thematic focus. These topics are likely the result of a topic modeling analysis, which identified
patterns and recurring themes across a collection of AI and machine learning research
documents. The terms within each topic provide insights into the specific areas of focus in the
research corpus. For example, Topic 1, which includes terms like "economic," "european," and
"political," suggests a focus on AI's impact within economic and policy-related contexts, while
Topic 3, with terms like "research," "ai," and "design," centers on core AI methodologies and
research practices. Other topics, such as Topic 7, with terms like "energy" and "security,"
indicate AI's application in areas like energy systems and cybersecurity.

 Figure 9 describes the yearly fluctuation in average sentiment across various
research topics. The y-axis represents average sentiment scores, while the x-axis shows the
timeline from 1985 to 2020. Each colored line corresponds to a different research topic.
Throughout the timeline, sentiment across all topics fluctuates, with notable variability in the
earlier years, particularly between 1985 and 2000, where sharp rises and falls are observed.
However, from 2000 onwards, the trends stabilize, and sentiment shows a gradual upward trend
across most topics, particularly from 2015 onward.

The Correlation Matrix in Figure 11 visualizes the relationships between sentiment scores across
eight distinct AI research topics. The matrix is color-coded, with darker red shades indicating
higher positive correlations and lighter shades reflecting weaker or negative correlations. Strong
positive correlations, such as between Topics 1 and 7 (0.95), or Topics 0 and 3 (0.90), suggest
thematic or perceptual overlap, meaning that research in these areas tends to evoke similar
sentiment reactions. In contrast, weaker correlations, such as between Topic 4 and Topic 2
(0.47), indicate that sentiment perceptions in these areas diverge, possibly due to differences in
focus or complexity.
